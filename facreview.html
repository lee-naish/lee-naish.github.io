Engineering faculty review</A>, December 2005</H1>
<H1>Lee Naish</H1>

<H2>Overview of recommendations</H2>

<UL>

<LI> To foster quality management and collegiality, department and faculty
staff should have input into yearly appraisal of Heads of Departments
and the Dean.

<LI> To ensure departments are adequately resourced during periods of
growth in student numbers, the faculty formula for teaching-based funding
of departments should be changed.

<LI> To best use our limited resources, we should not embark on a major
restructure of the faculty without strong evidence it would increase
our teaching and research efficiency.

<LI> To maximise teaching-based income and quality of students, the
faculty should embrace price discrimination for full-fee paying courses
and, if undergraduate courses are restructured, differential enter scores
should be retained.

<LI> To meet our responsibilities as professionals, we must not abandon
fully HECS funded accredited engineering degrees based only on academic
and financial considerations; any decision must be primarily justified
by considering ethics and social responsibility.

</UL>



<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>
I am an academic (level C) in the department of Computer Science and
Software Engineering.  This is a personal submission, though I am also
in broad agreement with the content and style of the submission made on
behalf of our department.  I have had a continuous association with
the department since 1977, first as a student, completing a BSc(Hons)
then PhD, then as a staff member, appointed as a research fellow in
1985 then as lecturer and senior lecturer.  Since 2000 I have been
working part time, primarily for health reasons.

<H2>Decision-making in the faculty</H2>

<P>
This review is part of a process which may result in extremely
important decisions for the whole faculty and I greatly value the
opportunity to make a submission.  As a level C academic I have minimal
power over decision at the department, faculty or university level.
The decision-making mechanisms are largely autocratic.  Some
department heads and deans (and vice chancellors) choose to be more
collegiate in their decision making.  The value of this is not that we
come closer to the ideal of democracy, but we come closer to the ideal
of meritocracy.  We place truth above ideology and believe the best way
to reach the truth is by considering evidence and logical
argumentation.  Our core business is generating and communicating
ideas.  We know that collaboration improves productivity and the best
way to distinguish good ideas from not so good ideas is though peer
review.

<P>
However, at various times during my long association with the
university, it has been apparent that heads of departments, deans and
vice chancellors have paid only lip service to collegiality.  They can
become out of touch with members of staff and make bad decisions.
Although staff members are sometimes asked their opinions (such as in
this review, and when the previous Dean's term ended in 2000), the
occasions are few and far between.  It is possible for staff to
directly approach a head or dean at any time, but the times when a
change of course are most needed are exactly the times such approaches
are most difficult and least effective.  A partial solution to this is
to ask for staff input more regularly.  It could be conveniently linked
to the annual staff appraisal process.  Just as teaching staff are
appraised with student feedback from "Quality of Teaching" surveys in
mind, Heads and Deans could be appraised with staff feedback in mind.

<H2>Teaching-based funding for departments</H2>

<P> By far the worst time our department has had in its history was
around the end of the 1990's.  Our student/staff ratio approximately
doubled over a period of three years.  Work load was at an all time high,
morale was at an all time low and several staff left the department (and I
could no longer sustain full-time work).  This should never be repeated.
One cause was the general under-funding of universities, another was
the vice chancellor's very poor decision to increase student numbers
despite lack of funding, but another was the formula the faculty uses
for determining department income related to teaching.  The latter two
causes were a symptoms of lack of collegiality and poor decision making
at the university and faculty level, respectively.

<P>
The formula is based on a three year rolling average.  Such a formula
works well when student numbers are reasonably stable.  However, when
numbers increase significantly departments are effectively paid in
arrears, putting huge strain on department resources (particularly staff).
We are in a relatively comfortable position now due to falling student
numbers.  One possible alternative model is as follows.  Departments are
given the option of predicting student numbers for the following year
and funding is based on that prediction.  If numbers are underestimated,
the surplus is added to the department budget the following year and if
numbers are overestimated the deficit (plus some interest) is subtracted.


<H2>Faculty structure</H2>

<P> The suggestion of the previous section assumes there is no major
change in the structure of the faculty.  I will avoid taking up too much
space re-iterating the arguments against major change put forward in the
CSSE department submission.  Our department has always, through necessity,
been quite lean and efficient with respect to support staff.  For many
years we were funded as a non-laboratory based science (like mathematics),
despite having to provide substantial computing infrastructure for both
teaching and research.  Soon after this was rectified we were moved
to the engineering faculty, where the teaching-based funding formula
was such that every other department was funded in proportion to their
teaching numbers but our funding was less (this is unrelated to the point
raised in the previous section).  Again this took many years to rectify.
Thus, over several decades we have taught high numbers of students more
efficiently than other departments and provided substantial computing
infrastructure at a small fraction of the cost of the central university
IT provider.  At the same time we have developed a good research profile,
through an evolving set of informal "groups", "projects", and "labs"
with virtually no administrative overheads and been instrumental in
significant technology transfer (not least, our role in bringing the
internet to Australia).

<P> Our experience with the Collaborative Information Technology Research
Institute some years ago was that virtually all the (substantial) funding
was essentially wasted on salaries for directors and administrative
staff and (often duplicated) infrastructure.  It probably had a negative
impact overall.  Lessons from CITRI were used in negotiations for our
involvement with NICTA, but it is still unclear if the research outcomes
of NICTA will represent good value for money considering the administrative
overheads, including the thousands of hours highly productive researchers
have already spent in meetings.  The faculty should aim at teaching
and research efficiency, where all sources of funding are considered
inputs rather than outputs.  A major restructure of the faculty would
cost a great deal of money and time, and a disproportionate amount of
the time would be spent by highly productive researchers.  Even if the
new structure did lead to more efficient teaching and research in the
longer term (which is doubtful), it should be compared with the outcome
if a similar effort was put into increasing efficiency without a major
restructure, or we just concentrated on doing our research.


<H2>Price discrimination</H2>

<P> I believe the faculty (and university) should be able to increase
its full-fee teaching income and quality of students by using price
discrimination.  We should try to charge each student as much as they are
willing to pay, as long as they are willing to pay more than the marginal
cost of teaching them.  Currently the faculty has fixed fees for each
course so some students pay less than they are willing to pay and other
excellent students do not apply, even though they would be happy to pay
more than the marginal cost.  The faculty could effectively introduce
price discrimination by increasing fees and offering scholarships and/or
bursaries.  Even without price discrimination, potential students are
likely to prefer a $40000 degree with a $10000 scholarship (which they can
mention on their CV) to a $30000 degree with no scholarship.  The size
of the scholarship can be related to inability or unwillingness to pay
(this can be estimated in various ways, such as willingness to negotiate
a maze of deadlines and paperwork), rather than academic merit alone.

<P> Similarly, many students would be willing to pay higher fees
if they have a guarantee of a bursary where they perform a certain
number of hours of casual work such as undergraduate lab supervision.
We could also charge more for some degrees than others (for example the
new ME in Distributed Computing could have higher fees than the Masters
of Software Systems Engineering) even though the actual subjects taken
by students could be identical.  If we do pursue price discrimination
it is important to streamline the faculty processes and make potential
students do the bulk of the work rather than us.

<P> Some may argue that such things are inequitable and counter to the
merit based philosophy of the university.  However, any fee structure is
counter to the merit based philosophy.  By charging fees which are more
in line with student's ability to pay is an improvement over fixed fees.
For example, ideally we should be able to accept a good student who can
only afford slightly more than the marginal cost, which is significantly
below the current fee.

<P> A form of price discrimination currently seems to work for the faculty
for HECS places.  There is a strong perception that students with good
marks in high school don't want to "waste" them on courses with relatively
low "enter" scores.  This seems to be one reason for the popularity of
combined degrees amongst the high performing students.  Although this
helps maintain the number of (good) students, there are significant costs
of combined degrees (not least is that having completed around six years
as an undergraduate they are unlikely to stay on to do a higher degree).
If undergraduate courses are re-structured it would be prudent to retain
multiple paths into the courses with different enter scores.  For example,
"BE leading to ME" could have a higher enter score than a plain BE,
even though subsequent acceptance into ME is based entirely on academic
performance during the BE.


<H2>Restructuring of undergraduate degrees</H2>

<P>
There has been a recent flurry of activity in the faculty discussing
possible changes in the structure of undergraduate courses, for example,
dropping the current four year BE and adopting a "3+2" model, citing the
"Bologna declaration" (which, it is worth noting, also endorses the "4+1"
model we currently have).  The motivations and process have been largely
opaque and there has not yet been sufficient time to properly consider
our goals, develop detailed alternative proposals and evaluate them.
I believe the faculty review panel will not be in a position to make an
informed judgment on the best outcome, though it may help clarify some
issues and suggest a process by which the matter can be decided.

<P> I am in no doubt that the combined wisdom of the faculty can
design academically excellent courses with many different structures.
For example, a four year degree which does not lock students into a
single discipline from the outset.  I see no academic reason why there
could not also be a more graceful transition to a Masters degree and exit
after three years (without engineering accreditation).  However, there
are also financial and ethical considerations to course structure which
must not be ignored.  Within our department, the main criticism of the
draft department submission to the review was the lack of discussion of
accessibility in a 3+2 model (discussion was not included because there
was doubt that consensus could be reached, though this question was not
actually tested).  A core issue is the financial cost of an accredited
engineering degree to an Australian student.  Tempting as it is to sweep
this issue under the carpet, it must be confronted.

<P> As professionals, we have considerable power to influence society
and the responsibility to ensure our influence is a good one.  Doing the
right thing must be our first priority and doing it with excellence
our second priority, not the reverse.  It may be within the combined
power of the faculty and the review panel to stop the University of
Melbourne providing accredited engineering degrees which are fully covered
by HECS.  It is hard to see how this would not decrease accessibility.
Accessibility has gradually been eroded by successive federal governments
but we should resist this trend, not be complicit in it.  There may of
course be arguments against this, such as the standard of engineering
education we provide with current resources is so low that it be an
insignificant loss.  Debate on ethics and social responsibility should
not end when we pass the undergraduate subject which covers that topic.
It is urgently needed now.
