<h1>Bangkok, 03-09-2007

<p> On the 3/9/07 we walked to the Grand Palace. We saw the emerald Buddha
and today he was wearing his wet season outfit. He has two other outfits,
one for the cold season and one for the hot season.  We saw lots of
plants. We saw lots of golden buidings and gold and colourful statues
of demons and other creatures. We saw lots of poles that had golden
tiles on them. We were going to go to another temple called wat poh,
but we were told it wasn't open and I didn't feel like going. After that,
we went on a boat to China town, and we bought a pencil case. Chinatown
was very crowded and not very Chinesey. We saw lots of jewellery. Then
we took a tuk tuk to the hotel and mamma read almost a whole chapter of
Harry Potter, the philosophers stone, which we bought here in Bangkok
yesterday. Today was an exciting experience but an exhausting day and
we didn't do all that much more for the rest of the day.
