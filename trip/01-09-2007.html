<h1>Bangkok, 01-09-2007</h1>

<p> On 01-09-2007 my family and I woke up on a plane and had breakfast at
5 o'clock.  I had eaten so much that I vomited!  We landed in Thailand and
it was wet because Thailand is wet and humid.  After that we went through
the airport and my passport got the first stamp.  It was a purple stamp
and a rectangle shape.  Next we caught a bus.  We waited for a long time
in the heat then finally the bus came and we got on.  Next we went to
a hotel and lay down.  I had a very late breakfast because I vomited.
It was a delicious breakfast.  Afterwards my dad and I went down to
the swimming pool and had fun splashing.  We got very wet and warm.
Then we walked back to our room and I read by myself a bit of The
Magician's Nephew.  It was exciting being in a different country.
