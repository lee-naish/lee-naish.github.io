<h1>Jasmine's trip, November/December 2010</h1>
<h2>Sat Nov 27</h2>

<p>
Today is one day before my birthday and I am going to Sydney for my
dad's conference and my birthday.  We arrived at the airport one and a
half hours early so we had to wait for an hours and a half.  For some of
the time we looked in a book shop.  The we heard the rumour, which was
then confirmed, that the flight was delayed for another hour and a half.
When we were walking to the plane it started raining, which wasn't very
pleasant as ther was wind as well and to make matters worse there was
no cover.  We had to walk across the tarmac and up the stairs (it was
Tiger Airways).  It was an A320 Airbus.  When we eventualy got on I
found it scarey taking off but then I soon got used to it.  The flight
was only about an hour so it wasn't too tiring.  When we landed I was
happy that I didn't get sick.

Once we got out of the airport we got a taxi to our appartment which was
at the Oaks Maestri Towers on Sussex St.

<h2>Sun Nov 28 - <font color="red">MY BIRTHDAY!!!!!</font></h2>

<p>
Today it is my birthday and one of the first things I did was opened my
presents.  From my dad I got a DS game (Mario Party) and my Mum said the
next day we would go shopping for dresses for me.  In the morning we
went to Paddy's market to go shopping for fruit and vegies.  I really
wanted to get some pringles so we got some from the IGA supermarket
upstairs.  They were delicious but we thought there would be more in the
packet.  Then we came back home and I played on my DS a bit.  Then we
had lunch.  I had a sandwwhich with tomatoe, cucumber and lettuce as we
didn't have much else.  Shortly after that we went to afternoon tea at a
place next door called the chocolate room.  We had chocolate fondue and
strawberries.  We really liked it and think we might go back there in
future.
</p>

<p>
When we got back we expected my Mum's old work friend, Belle, and her
husband, Dwayne, to come over from Paramatta but they were quite late.
When they did get here they gave me a present.  It was a diary and it
was really pretty.  Then we went out to dinner.  We decided to go to
Chinatown.  There were lots of spruikers and we went to the first one we
met.  She seemed very kind and gave us a three dollar discount for the
set menu.  We were escorted upstairs and were seated in a nice place
with facny light fittings and decorations.  We were just discussing what
to order when a waiter came up to us and said "you order now" when we
had only just sat down.  We started to order and couldn't decide on
something so she said "I come back later".  Once we had ordered and the
food came we were disappointed to see that most of the dished were
mostly Chinese broccoli and bok choy.
</p>

<p>
After dinner we decided we would not come back.  So then we decided to
go and get some dessert.  We  went to an asian dessert place and each of
us had an icecream.  Bell, Dwayne and Donna has mini icecream that were
coated in chocolate and me and Lee both had a icecream each.  I had
mango and rasberry and Lee had green tea.  After that Belle and Dwayne
drove home (near Cessnock) and we went back to our appartment for the
night.

<h2>Mon Nov 29 - Famous Icons</h2>

<p>
Today we had a busy day.  We slept in until about 9:30 and then had
breakfast.  I had the usual, which is porridge, fruit and toast.  After
breakfast me and my mum went shopping for my birthday to buy dresses for
me.  First we decided to go to Woolworths just on case they had some
childrens clothes because it was very big.  We also decided to look for
chocolates for my mum's friends that lived in Manly that we would visit
later in the day.  We didn't find either of those things so we decided
to go to Myer to look for clothes for me.  It took a while to find the
right section but eventually we did.  First we decided to get some
dresses and clothes that I liked then try them all on.  I got a pair of
blue shorts, a red dress with white polka dots, a summery dress that had
flowers on it and pockets, another summery one which was similar, a
1980's style dress, a dress that was white with blue and green leaves on
it and some others.  We we went in the change room we found about two
were too big and some others were too small.  In the end we decided to
get the first three.
</p>

<p> When we came home I did a fashion parade down our long corridor.
My dad's favourite thing was the red dress.  Shortly after we walked to
the opera house via Hyde Park.  We didn't get a tour but took quite a few
photos if it and the Sydney harbour bridge.  Then we went to Circular Quay
to get tickets to Manly.  Then we met my dad's old work friend, Jason,
at the museum of contemporary art.  We soon discovered that the parts we
wanted to go to were blocked off so we decided to go to the cafe.  Me and
Jason bot got a cranberry juice and my parents got coffees.  Soon after
we had to get the ferry to Manly, where, on the second floor we met one of
Donna's old school friends called Andrew.  When we got to Manly, Andrew's
wife, Letizia picked us up from the ferry.  Once we got to their house
I met their two girls, Olivia and Emma.  We stayed there for dinner.
For dinner we had dips, pizzas and salad.  For desserts we had three
types of cake - flourless chocolate cake, rasbberry and white chocolate
cake and pecan chocolate pie.  I got really full on cake and then felt
a bit sick.  Shortly after we gotr driven back to the ferry terminal to
get home.  On the ferry we stayed outside for most of the time as there
was a lovely view of the city and the conterpoint tower.  There were
lots of seagulls flying along with us, catching fish.  We we got home
we had to swipe our key thingy to get in as it was about 11 oclock.  </p>
