This page is maintained by
<A HREF="http://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/lee">Lee Naish</A>, Privacy Liaison Officer
for the <a href="http://www.cis.unimelb.edu.au/">Department of Computing
and Information Systems</a>,
(and previously Computer Science and Software Engineering)
<A HREF="http://www.unimelb.edu.au/">University of Melbourne</A> since
June 2002.  It contains resources concerning privacy issues in our
department.  Privacy issues are important, especially for computing
professionals.  Even if nobody in our department has any concerns about
invasion of their privacy, raising awareness of privacy issues amongst
both staff and students in our department is worthwhile.  Any opinions
expressed here are personal and should not be taken as official policy.

<H2>Reporting Privacy Concerns</H2>
I am happy to hear any privacy concerns from students and staff in our
department.  My contact information is as follows.

</TABLE>
Since I work only part time, e-mail is probably the most easy and reliable 
way to contact me (though not necessarily the most private).
<P>
If you don't trust me, you may like to contact the head of department, the
<A HREF="mailto:privacy-officer@unimelb.edu.au">University Privacy Officer</A>
(see also the
<A HREF="http://www.unimelb.edu.au/unisec/privacy">
University privacy page</A>)
or the
<A HREF="http://privacy.vic.gov.au">Victorian Privacy Commissioner</A>.
<P>

If you don't trust the system administrators (I have reasonable
trust in them) or the security of the system (which is not high),
and/or want to remain anonymous, you should not send sensitive e-mail
from a local machine.  Use another account, for example, go to a cyber
cafe, create a web-based e-mail account for yourself using a fake name
and send e-mail from that.  You may also send me e-mail encrypted with
<A HREF="privacypub.asc.txt">this</A> PGP (or GPG) public key.  Note
that despite the 2048 bit "military grade" encryption,
I'm likely to decrypt the message on a department machine and
its possible (though not likely) the plain text may be seen by a
sysadmin or hacker.  Alternatively, somebody may have hacked the file
containing the public key, allowing only them to decrypt your e-mail
instead of me.  Or the locally installed version of pgp
might contain a key logger trojan, et cetera.
Communicating by phone or letter is probably more secure.
I am not disclosing my home address or phone number - thats private!

<H2>Why is the University concerned about privacy?</H2>
The cynical answer is that it must comply with the
<A HREF="http://www.dms.dpc.vic.gov.au:80/">
Victorian Information Privacy Act, 2000</A>.  Actually, for many of the
activities of the university it has had to comply with the
Commonwealth Privacy Act, 1988,
so appointing a privacy officer was actually well overdue.
<!-- Overall I think the University has a reasonable track record on privacy, -->
<!-- but its a big organisation with personal information on many thousands -->
<!-- of individuals so vigilance is warranted. -->

<H2>Privacy Issues</H2>

In this section I list some privacy issues which have been raised in
our department.
I occasionally update this section, but the chances are there are more
recent issues which are not documented here.

<!-- <H3>"Quality of Teaching" surveys</H3> -->

<H3> Good news (finally) - Booking flu vaccinations</H3>
In 2010 the University outsourced coordination of staff/postgraduate
student flu vaccinations.  This involved staff and students entering
personal information into an online form.  The website had a <a
href="vacpriv.pdf"> privacy policy available</A> (though you had to
enable cookies and enter some information into a form in order to get to
it) which said the purpose of the company collecting information is "to
further its business purposes".  It went on to say "You consent to the
Company having an unrestricted right to use and store such information
on the company's internal computer systems", amongst other thing.
My objections lead to revision of their privacy policy and a review of how
the University treats privacy in its external contracts.  The standard
"Acquisition of Services Agreement (Non-IT services)" was used in this
case.  Conditions apply to information provided by the University to
the service provider but they do not necessarily cover information that
individuals provide directly to the service provider. This is becoming
increasingly common - where we previously provided information to an admin
staff member employed by the university (or they looked it up for us),
we now enter it into some online system, which may be outsourced to a
company which values our private information more than our privacy.
<p>
In 2011 a different external service provider was used by the university
for flu vaccination bookings, which was even worse in some respects.
For example, there was no privacy policy displayed on the site and the
site used Google Analytics, so Google could track people who
registered for a flu shot.  I complained again and was assured that the
provider had signed the appropriate contract with the universty so our
personal information would not be divulged by the service provider, and
that the company would be asked to put a privacy policy on their site.
In 2012 yet another external service provider was used, but this time
they finally got it right - there was what I considered to be a very
reasonable privacy policy linked to the booking page.  I sent a
congratulatory e-mail.
<p>

<H3>Other online booking issues</H3>
In November 2012 the department and NICTA announced two seminars to
celebrate the Turing centenary.  To attend it was necessary to register
via a commercial events booking service which had no privacy policy.  I
registered using a fake name etc, downloaded my tickets, and complained
to the organisers.
<p>

In October 2012 the university lauched the Melbourne School of
Information (organised by the Melbourne School of Engineering).
In order to attend, personal information had to be entered
into a web form of a company which manages events.   Under their privacy
policy it said "We may use your Personal Data to contact you in the
future for our marketing and advertising purposes" and by default, booking
for the launch signed up attendees to their newsletter, which you could
only avoid by creating an account with them and changing your e-mail
preferences.  I registered using a false name and e-mail address, and
complained.
<p>

In January 2004 staff in Information Systems arranged for a massuer to
visit our building for the benefit of staff and students.  An web-based
booking system was implemented on a .com.au web site run by a DIS staff
member.  The massage booking web site was designed to collect e-mail
addresses and phone numbers but there was no information about who runs
the web site, the purpose of collecting the information, how securely
it is stored, who is given access to it et cetera.  I don't think our
students (or staff) should be encouraged to provide personal information
to such a web site and requested that the site be updated to provide more
information.  A <A HREF="http://massage.weeweb.com.au/privacy/">privacy
page</A> was added to the site quite promptly, providing information and
the ability for users to view all information stored about them (password
protected).  The ability to book a massage by phone was also introduced.

<H3>Good news: DETYA report, Casual staff management, network and proxy
monitoring...</H3>
<a name="good">

In July 2004 staff in the Department were informed that an annual report
to DETYA required information on "country of birth other than Australia"
and "primary language spoken at home" for staff.  The good news is our
department manager also informed us that "No other personal information
is disclosed".
<P>
In August 2004 I was approached about privacy aspects of requirements
for a casual staff management system.  Its is nice that the Department
was pro-active on this matter rather than implementing the system then
have someone mention there are privacy implications.  There were some
discussions in 2007 about what to do with comments made by students
about individual casual staff.
<P>
In September 2005 I was approached about privacy aspects of testing a
network intrusion detection system which collects data packets within
the CSSE computer network.  Some effort was put in place to
ensure no personally identifiable information was retained.
<P>
In January 2006 I was approached about privacy aspects of
<A HREF="https://www.csse.unimelb.edu.au/local/tech/policies/logging/searchlog/index.html">
collecting information from our web proxy</A>.  Information retrieval
researchers in
the department wanted to capture information about queries to search
engines such as Google, and subsequent user behaviour (for example,
which links they followed).  Substantial thought was put into designing
a system of filtering potentially sensitive queries, anonymising
information, obtaining informed consent of users and allowing
<A HREF="https://mailhost.csse.unimelb.edu.au/cgi-bin/opt-out">
opt-out</A>
provisions.  For example, it was initially considered that obtaining informed
consent from undergraduates was impossible so only data from staff and
postgraduates should be collected (I believe data from students may now
be collected; I had some input into simplifying the language in the
notice to students).  Also any query containing a name of
anyone in the department, plus various other key words, would be
filtered out.  The system has now been set up.  In March an e-mail was
sent reminding people of the system; the opt in/out part of the system
appeared to still work.
<P>

After the University Open Day in 2007 staff were asked to complete a
survey, and privacy issues were addressed in the request.
<p>

The final package of documentation for the 2009 ACS/EA accreditation of
our courses was labelled
<blockquote>
Confidential, may not be copied or circulated or used for any
purpose other than the 2009 EA Accreditation
Visit to the University of Melbourne.
</blockquote>

<H3>RQF research spreadsheets and staff ids</H3>
In November 2007, as part of the Research Quality Framework "dry run"
(the RQF was abandonned very soon after this), the employee numbers
of all staff with research output involved in the RQF was put on a
web site accessible to anyone with a Unimelb staff e-mail account.
Employee numbers are used for authentication for various things, from
the photocopier in our department to redirecting staff salaries to arbitrary
bank accounts.  In reply to my e-mails I was told "Thank you for
expressing your concerns. Please be advised however that
Employees numbers are not confidential".  One problem (which I pointed
out, and has not been rectified) is that the university does not make
clear what is meant to be confidential and what isn't.  Having expressed
support for my stand, the head of department supressed employee number
information on some handouts for a department meeting but failed to
elsewhere (I didn't actually notice until he e-mailed me).

<H3>Access to student project submissions and other files</H3>
In March 2007 an academic from another university asked our head of
department for copies of old student submissions to help with research on
plagiarism detection.  I recommended that we not provide the submissions,
though we could offer to run experimental plagiarism detection software
locally and provide some results.  This was agreed to.
<p>

In late 2008 a UoM academic asked a sysadmin to provide <em>all</em>
student files from a first year Informatics subject (not just files
submitted for assessment), to look for evidence of plagiarism.   After
discussion with me and the HoD the request was refused.

<H3>Enrollment numbers and other unique IDs</H3>
Each student has a growing number of unique IDs, for example enrollment
number, "unimelb" e-mail address, "csse" login ID, etc.  What is the
purpose of each of these IDs and what information can what people get
from each one?  What are legitimate reasons for staff to use an
enrollment number to look up student records?  In my experience our
department behaves responsibly in this respect but it would be nice to
have some guidelines.
<P>
There has long been a practice of publishing lists of academic results
using enrollment numbers (rather than names).  In our department it is
common for project marks to be published on Web pages using enrollment
numbers and in at least one subject in 2003 final results were published
in this way.  The (unstated) assumptions
are that students have a right to privacy with respect to their results
and enrollment numbers are also private.  In contrast, "unimelb" e-mail
addresses are not considered private, at least within the University
(the university web site has an e-mail directory).  The "private" nature
of enrollment numbers is important and should be explicitly stated to
all staff and students.  This would reduce the chance of enrollment
numbers being linked to other identifying information.  For example, in
the past I have seen lists of names, enrollment numbers and tutorial
allocations displayed.  In February 2004 I spotted such a list for one
tutorial in our department, online in a place where all students could
read it (it had been there for six months).  Such lists were created
routinely and still had enrollment numbers in second semester 2004 (and
some were probably passed around classes so people could tick off their
names).  I
reminded staff that they must be treated with care and requested
enrollment numbers not be included in the future (I asked academics if
they wanted them included and nobody replied).  This has been done.
However, there are now photo lists available as well, and as of March
2006 they included enrollment numbers.  E-mail was sent to all academics
requesting that this information be blacked out before distribution to
tutors etc. and I hope the information can be avoided in the future (I
even wrote a little shell script to doctor the Postscript files).
<P>
In May 2003 I also noted that the
<A HREF="http://www.cs.mu.oz.au/mu-csa/">
Computer Students Association</A> required enrollment number and various
personal information to join their mailing list.  I suggested that
this be discontinued and student IDs collected previously be deleted.
The request for enrollment numbers was, thankfully, immediately removed
and MU-CSA members have requested further discussions with me concerning
privacy.  In December 2003, a student also alerted me to the fact that
for some group projects in CSSE students are requested to provide
enrollment numbers of all students in the submission, allowing students
to obtain enrollment numbers of other students.  There are many subjects
which have group projects, and in some the groups are quite large.
Since academics in the department can easily convert from CSSE login ids
to enrollment numbers, I see no strong reason for
weakening privacy by asking for enrollment numbers instead.  This issue
was taken up with the department, eventually resulting in an official 
<A HREF="http://www.cs.mu.oz.au/policy/privacy.html">
Department policy</A> (a rare thing indeed), in March 2004.
In September 2004 a brief audit revealed a couple of subjects which
violated the policy and an e-mail was sent to all academic staff.
<P>
I have also raised some of these matters briefly with the University
Privacy Officer.  It was pointed out that as of September 1, 2002, forms
requesting personal information need to state the purposes to which it
will be put.  However, this does not address the question of what
happens to the information the University generates, such as academic
results, for which privacy is expected.
<P>
The relationship between casual staff in our department and their
concurrent or previous role as students has also been raised.  There
has been at least one instance in 2004 of an enrollment number being
requested for the creation of an account for a casual, and the form
requesting an account for casual staff asked for either student
enrollment number or staff number.  The form now asks for staff number
and mentions enrollment numbers should be avoided for privacy reasons.

<H3>Staff CVs</H3>

Some years ago, CSSE staff were asked to provide CVs as part of a
department review.  Later these CVs were collated and distributed to all
staff (and who knows where else) - not the purpose of collecting the data.
Publications while employed at the University are collected and cited in
the Research Report, but prior publications, employment and consulting
history of staff should only be used for the purpose they were collected
for unless staff give explicit permission.  More recently there was a
suggestion that staff provide CVs for the purpose of obtaining research
funding from a particular source.  I requested the information only be
used for this purpose.
<P>
In June 2004 staff were again requested to provided CVs and required fill
in a survey for the purpose of gaining ACS and IEAust accreditation for
our courses.  As well as not using the information for other purposes,
some staff queried the University collecting personal information such as
"membership of professional or other bodies" and "consulting work",
despite arguably being at odds with the University privacy policy.
Staff were (at least initially) given no assurances as to what would be
done with the information.  Some staff refused to supply some information.
Some senior staff expressed disappointment - below is an extract of an
e-mail response I made.
<blockquote>

I agree the process and outcome have been disappointing from some
perspectives.  I have always favoured strongly encouraging people to
provide as much information as they are comfortable with.  However,
people have been told they are <em>required</em> to supply certain
information and some requested information includes such things as
membership of organisations (not just professional organisations) and
there were no assurances given concerning privacy.  It wasn't as blunt
as asking about race, religion, union membership or "are you a member of
the communist party" (though the latter two are implicit in membership
of organisations) but it was out of line with accepted community and
university standards wrt privacy.
<P>

Some of our staff are rather sensitive about privacy (for reasonable
reasons I believe) - certainly more sensitive than me, and they probably
reacted negatively to this.  I feel I have a duty to support their right
to withhold such information, no matter what the reaction is at the
faculty level or elsewhere.
<P>

...
<P>
I am proud our department is actively defending privacy!  I'm not a
member of ACS, but I have read their code of ethics.  It would be ironic
indeed if they deny us accreditation because we are adhering to their
code of ethics!  I imagine that raising these issues with them would be
seen as a positive rather than a negative.  I'm not sure about IEAust -
they probably have less interest in privacy because engineers have done
less to erode privacy (though the IEEE code of ethics mentions privacy
I'm pretty sure).  Both ACS and IEAust say they welcome feedback on their
accreditation processes.  It is my hope than we gain accreditation from
both bodies <em>and</em> help them improve their processes.
</blockquote>

Discussions about the whole process were initiated with the hope that
such exercises would be more sensitive to staff privacy in the future.
Ideally, accreditation bodies should be more pro-active in this respect.
They are open to suggestions for their accreditation manuals and I have
suggested that a section on privacy should be included.  They should
attempt to only request relevant information, make assurances regarding
confidentiality and destruction of data and suggest that institutions
do the same and communicate the policies and procedures to the staff
whose privacy is at stake.  Happily, we passed both accreditations with
flying colours.
<P>

In March 2006 academics were again asked by the Faculty to supply their
CVs, so preparations could be made for the transition to the Research
Quality Framework.  Concern was again expressed; CVs typically contain
more than the necessary information.  Some also noted that the University
already expends considerable effort collecting and collating information
about research output of all academic staff, so the request was
questionable even ignoring privacy considerations.
<p>

In late 2008 the ACS and EA accreditation process began again.  I
e-mailed the following to CSSE academics and the person in charge of the
process for the MSE:
<blockquote>
Last time we did this, in 2004, there was a degree of insensitivity wrt
privacy, and we have not had a great track record with collection of staff
CVs in our department/Faculty - see http://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/lee/privacy/
<p>

Let me make some suggestions to try to avoid any more unpleasantness
this time around.
<p>

First, the School should undertake to only use this information for the
purpose of this accreditation.  Ideally the data should be destroyed
once accreditation is granted, and Engineers Australia, at the request
of the School, should do the same with any copies they have.
<p>

Second, academics should be encouraged *but not required* to include
information which may be beneficial for the accreditation outcome but
is not directly related to employment by the University.  The memo as
it is currently worded *requires* "Consulting record (2004 onwards)".
Wearing my Privacy Liaison Officer hat, I think this is way out of line,
especially considering there is nothing said about where the data might
end up.  To those academics who are sensitive about such information, I
suggest you simply omit it (the same applies to Experience in professional
practice and some of the other categories mentioned).  The bottom line is
that you should not feel compelled to include information not directly
related to employment by the University.
</blockquote>

This instigated a long discussion; here are a couple of snippets.
From someone in the MSE:
<blockquote>
I had not thought of the privacy angle and am sorry to hear that some
people find some of the requests providing CV's as a concern.  We have
never had an issue about this in our department so this comes to me as a
surprise.
</blockquote>
From the Head of CSSE:
<blockquote>
The critical requirement of a good privacy policy is
to have in place assurances that data collected for one purpose --
the one for which it was supplied -- is not then deliberately or
even inadvertentlt used for a different purpose. And, of course,
dealing with information is an area of engineering the CSSE does have
particular expertise in, which is why I am pleased that Lee thought to
inject his comments...
</blockquote>
<p>

With the strong support of the Head of CSSE (but apparently very little
from the rest of the MSE) the eventual outcome was
reasonable - see the <a href="./#good"> good news section</a>.

<H3>Intrusion Detection System</H3>
The department is considering installing an intrusion detection system
for the department's computer systems.  I have had some input into the
proposal to ensure that privacy matters are approriately addressed.

<H3>University Audio-Visual Copyright Survey, 2003</H3>
The University (as part of the AVCC) has an arrangement which allows
copying programs from TV
etc. for teaching purposes.  In return, staff are surveyed from time to
time to find out what copying is done, so royalties can be
distributed by Screenrights.  In 2003 this survey was done
by A C Neilsen.  The forms, which
<strong>the University instructed staff to complete</strong>,
asked for name, signature and contact phone number. It was
questioned whether this information was necessary for the purpose of the
survey (wouldn't it be sufficient to provide aggregate information on
what was copied, without linking it to personal information?).
Furthermore, the forms did not make it clear who would have
access to the information, who staff could contact to review and update
information etc. The collection of only necessary information and
stating who will have access to the information and who can be contacted
to review and change information are important
information privacy principles in Victorian and Federal law.
<P>
The matter was discussed with the University Privacy Officer,
the University copyright officer, state and federal
privacy offices and state and federal union offices.
The response of the University Privacy Officer was disappointing.  He
said it was an issue for A C Neilsen to deal with, not him.  According
to the 2003 edition of the Melbourne University Magazine
<blockquote>
The University of Melbourne is committed to protecting and using
personal information about students, staff, alumni and benefactors
in accordance with all relevant privacy laws.
</blockquote>
This is a post-script to an article by Victorian Privacy Commissioner
Paul Chadwick, in which he states
<blockquote>
One of the most striking features of Privacy is the way is is
over-venerated in summary form and then undervalued in the detail.
</blockquote>
<P>
Privacy Victoria was helpful, but also somewhat disappointing.
They have the power to
act on a matter if someone complains that their privacy rights have been
violated (and then the first step is conciliation), but can't be
pro-active to avoid privacy violations.  The union was
not up to speed on privacy issues and was not able to be pro-active
either.
<P>
Our department initially withheld all forms from A C Neilson.  Eventually
they were returned, though some staff chose to not to participate, or
provided partial or imprecise information.  There is a chance that our
input will make the process better in the future.

<H3>Union Enterprise Bargaining Agreement</H3>
I suggested that the University's committment to protecting (as
well as respecting) staff privacy be elevated from the pages of
the Melbourne University Magazine to the 2003 EBA.



<H3>Surveilance</H3>
The university has posted signs around campus
alerting people to the use of surveilance cameras
in the area.  I queried the use of surveilance cameras by the University
in public areas (eg, Grattan St.) in a Departmental meeting.  Surveilance
is covered by separate legislation to "information privacy" and I have
not (yet) read the legislation.  The University claims to abide by the
legislation. This does not necessarily imply it is "doing the right thing".

<P>
The department has also installed (at least one) camera.  I have been
involved with discussions about its orientation, to avoid the offices of
staff-members being in the field of view, and appropriate signs.

<H3>Secure Document Destruction</H3>
When the department moved buildings late in 2002, tonnes of paper
was thrown out of offices.  So called "secure" bins were provided for
sensitive information such as student records.  Although (some of) these
bins had chains and padlocks, the chains were not attached to the lids!
The bins could simply be opened.  They were also in a "public" area -
a corridor with little traffic.  Potentially, anyone could walk in and
rummage through the bins.  Many years ago (around 1980) the department
put a large pile of exam script book in a public area, awaiting removal.
I was free to rummage through the pile and collect several of mine.
I also spotted several of students I knew, and even academic staff who
had completed the Postgraduate Diploma in the department.

<H3>Staff home addresses</H3>

Staff need to provide the University their home address for taxation
purposes.  Melbourne Theatre Company (part of the corporate structure of
the University) uses these addresses for marketing - arguably not part of
the purpose of collecting this information from staff.  Some staff are
very concerned about who has access to their home address.  This matter
taken up with the University Privacy Officer.  The response was that
MTC is a University Department and thus permitted to have access to
staff home addresses.  This does not address the question of what is
appropriate use of the information.  Perhaps the University Privacy
Officer would welcome junk mail from any university department but there
are staff in our department who do not.
