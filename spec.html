<h1>433-326 Declarative Programming</h1>
<h1>Project 2</h1>
</center>

<h2>Aim</h2>

<p>
The primary aim of this project is for you to get further experience
with understanding and writing Haskell code, particularly higher order
code, where functions can be passed as arguments and embedded in data
structures.
You may do this project individually or in pairs.
</p>


<h2>Background</h2>

<p> XML is a simple markup language used for representing many forms
of data.  For example, this document is written in XHTML, which is a
subset of XML.  There are
several existing languages and packages for searching or <em>querying</em>
XML data.  In this project you will be implementing some Haskell functions
for querying XML.  A prototype will be provided; your task will be to
enhance it.  </p>

<p> An XML document can be seen as a textual representation of an M-way
tree.  There are two kinds of nodes.  First, there are <em>text</em>
nodes, which contain just text and have no children.  Second, there
nodes called <em>elements</em> which have a tag (a string, which appears
in angle brackets at the start of the element and in angle brackets
with a slash at the end of the element), a list of <em>attributes</em>
which are name-value pairs (also both strings, apearing in the first
set of angle brackets), and a list of subtrees (other elements or text
appearing between the instances of the tag).  Below is an example of the
syntax which uses a mix of standard HTML tags and specialised tags for
maintaining a blog.  The meaning of these tags, how they are displayed
and restrictions on how they may be arranged can be defined separately
in a schema, but for this project we ignore the precise meaning.
</p>

<pre>
&lt;blog&gt;
  &lt;message author="Alice" date="Wed, 05 May 2010 06:40:22"&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;A new blog&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;content&gt;I discovered a new &lt;b&gt;blogging engine&lt;/b&gt;. Trying it
      out.&lt;/content&gt;
    &lt;tag&gt;blogging&lt;/tag&gt;
    &lt;tag&gt;short&lt;/tag&gt;
    &lt;comment author="Bob" date="Wed, 05 May 2010 06:52:10"&gt;
      You should link it to your &lt;i&gt;Twitter&lt;/i&gt; feed.
      &lt;comment author="Alice" date="Thu, 06 May 2010 03:39:41"&gt;
        I might, if I can figure out how to do that.
      &lt;/comment&gt;
    &lt;/comment&gt;
    &lt;comment author="Dennis" date="Thu, 06 May 2010 01:14:08"&gt;
      Yes, this is a good one, Alice.
    &lt;/comment&gt;
  &lt;/message&gt;
&lt;/blog&gt;
</pre>

<p>
In Haskell, XML can be represented as follows:
</p>

<pre>
>data XML =
>	Text String |		-- text only (no subtrees)
>	Element String		-- tag
>		[Attr]		-- attributes
>		[XML]		-- subtrees

>type Attr = (String, String)
</pre>

<p>
This representation has the advantage that it can represent any XML
document.  However, this can also be a disadvantage, since it can represent
XML documents which do not conform to a given schema (for example, it is
unlikely we want to allow comments inside titles but this data type does
not prevent it).  The blog example above would be represented as follows:
</p>

<pre>
>blog :: XML
>blog =
>  Element "blog" []
>  [
>    Element "message" [("author", "Alice"),
>                         ("date", "Wed, 05 May 2010 06:40:22")]
>    [
>      Element "title" [] [Text "A new blog"],
>      Element "content" []
>      [
>        Text "I discovered a new ",
>        Element "b" [] [Text "blogging engine"],
>        Text ". Trying it out."
>      ],
>      Element "tag" [] [Text "blogging"],
>      Element "tag" [] [Text "short"],
>      Element "comment" [("author", "Bob"),
>                           ("date", "Wed, 05 May 2010 06:52:10")]
>      [
>        Text "You should link it to your ",
>        Element "i" [] [Text "Twitter"],
>        Text " feed.",
>        Element "comment" [("author", "Alice"),
>                             ("date", "Thu, 06 May 2010 03:39:41")]
>          [Text "I might, if I can figure out how to do that."]
>      ],
>      Element "comment" [("author", "Dennis"),
>                           ("date", "Thu, 06 May 2010 01:14:08")]
>        [Text "Yes, this is a good one, Alice."]
>    ]
>  ]

<h2>Querying XML</h2>

<p>
Various languages and packages have been developed for querying XML.
Here we will develop a framework for querying XML using Haskell.
</p>

<h3>Checking the content of single nodes</h3>

<p> One of the most basic things we often want to do is match an element
by checking whether the tag and/or attributes and values have certain
properties.  In Haskell this can be done in a general way by having a
function which takes this data and returns a Boolean.  Note this ignores
any subtrees; we handle the overall tree structure in a separate way,
described below.  Similarly we can use Boolean functions to check if
text nodes have desired properties.  The two types below thus describe
important basic matching operations.
</p>

<pre>
>type CheckElem = String -> [Attr] -> Bool
>type CheckText = String -> Bool
</pre>

<p>
For example, we could check if a text node contains the word "XML" and
an element node is a title (a tag of "title") as follows (more
general-purpose functions along the same lines can clearly be defined):
</p>

<pre>
>has_word_XML :: CheckText
>has_word_XML cs = not (null (filter (=="XML") (words cs)))

>is_title :: CheckElem
>is_title = has_tag "title"

>has_tag :: String -> CheckElem
>has_tag t tag _avs = tag = t
</pre>

<h3>Matching the overall tree structure</h3>

<p> To support queries which depend on the overall tree structure we
devise a data type for "patterns" which can be used to match XML trees.
Individual nodes can be matched using the <code>CheckElem</code> and
<code>CheckText</code> types, but we also want to constrain how the
node is related to other nodes.  For text nodes (where there are no
children), the pattern has a <code>CheckText</code> and a description
of what the list of ancestors nodes must be like.  The ancestors of
a node X are all elements, starting with the root node of the tree,
then a child of the root, <i>et cetera</i>, down to the parent of X.
For element nodes we have a <code>CheckElem</code>, a description of
the ancestors (as for text nodes) and also a description of the list
of children.  The children are subtrees and we allow nested patterns
to match these subtrees recursively (within these recursive matches,
the ancestors start with the root of the subtree).  </p>

<p> To constrain both the list of ancestors and the list of children,
we use a data type which is a more general version of lists, called
<code>Sequence</code>.  A Sequence of some type <code>t</code> is like
a list of <code>t</code>'s but more flexible.  For example, we can
say some element is anything (rather than a specific value of type
<code>t</code>) and we can say there are one or more occurrences of
some element or sub-sequence.  We define <code>Sequence</code> below.
The ancestors are described by a Sequence of <code>CheckElem</code>'s.
The children are described by a Sequence of patterns.  </p>

<p>
Thus patterns can be defined as follows:
</p>

<pre>
>data Pat =
>	TextPat (Sequence CheckElem)		-- ancestors
>		CheckText |			-- node check
>	ElemPat (Sequence CheckElem)		-- ancestors
>		CheckElem			-- node check
>		(Sequence Pat)			-- subtrees
</pre>

<p>
If the ancestors are always the empty sequence and the sequence
of subtrees is essentially the same as a list then the patterns are
essentialy the same structure as XML, but with Boolean functions instead
of data in the nodes.
</p>

<p> Sequences are defined as follows.  There are three data constructors
which are equivalent to <code>Nil</code>,  <code>Leaf</code>, and
<code>Branch</code> in the cord representation given in lectures (this
allows lists to be represented precisely).  They are <code>Empty</code>,
<code>One</code> and <code>Then</code>, respectively.  Additionally,
there is <code>Any1</code> which means any single element, <code>Several
s</code>, which means one or more occurrences of sequence <code>s</code>
and <code>Or s1 s2</code>, which means either sequence <code>s1</code>
or sequence <code>s2</code>.
</p>

<pre>
>data Sequence t =
>	Empty |                          -- the empty sequence
>	One t |                          -- a single item t
>	Any1  |                          -- any single item
>	Then (Sequence t) (Sequence t) | -- a sequence then another sequence
>	Or (Sequence t) (Sequence t) |   -- or sequence or another sequence
>	Several (Sequence t)             -- one or more occurrences
>		deriving Show
</pre>

<p> Note there is more than one way of specifying the same sequence.
For example, <code>One is_title</code> means the same as <code>Then
(One is_title) Empty</code>.  Consider the following examples.
<code>any_seq</code> is a sequence which matches anything.
<code>pat1</code> will match an element which has no ancestors (it must
be the root node) and which has tag "blog"; it can have any children.
<code>pat2</code> will match an element with any ancestors and tag
"message" and its first child must be an element with tag "title".
<code>pat3</code> will match a text node with at least one ancestor
(it must not be the root node) containing the word XML.
</p>

<pre>
>any_seq = (Or (Several Any1) Empty)
>pat1 = ElemPat Empty (has_tag "blog") any_seq
>pat2 = ElemPat any_seq (has_tag "message")
>       (Then (One (ElemPat Empty is_title any_seq)) any_seq)
>pat3 = TextPat (Several Any1) has_word_XML
</pre>

<!-- any_text = TextPat Empty (const True) -->
<!-- any_elem = ElemPat Empty (\x-> \y-> True) any_seq -->


<h3>A prototype implementation</h3>

<p>
A prototype implementation will be provided in
<code>/home/subjects/326/local/proj1/</code>.  It includes the Haskell
code in this document as well as other sample code for queries and a
definition of the function
</p>

<pre>
>match_pat :: Pat -> XML -> Bool
</pre>

<p>
which checks if a pattern matches some XML.  There are some cases in
which the code fails to find a match, even though it ideally should.
The reason for this is described in more detail the code; the solution
is one of the enhancements described below.  </p>

<a name="task">
</a>
<h2>Your task</h2>

<p>
You main task is to implement (at least some of) the following
enhancements to the prototype code.  You should not change the
representation of XML or patterns, except in the case explicitly
mentioned below.  How you structure your code is up to you, but you
should submit all your code and a <code>Makefile</code> which build an
executable called <code>demo</code>.  When this is run it should execute
some examples which demonstrate the features you have implemented.
Additionally, you should submit a faile named <code>Readme</code> which
summarises you submission (for example, the contents of the other
files).  If you are working in pairs, only one of the pair should submit
the code, but both should submit a filed named <code>Team</code> which
contains the names and CSSE login ids of the two team members.
</p>

<h3>Returning a subtree instead of a Boolean</h3>

<p>
The current code only allows us to determine if a match exists.
If <code>match_pat</code> returns True there is generally no indication
of which subtree matched (at least in the case where the ancestors can
be any sequence).  It is more useful to return the subtree which matched
the top level of the pattern.  The most convenient way to do this is for
<code>match_pat</code> to return <code>Just</code> the subtree if a
match is found, or <code>Nothing</code> otherwise.
</p>

<h3>Returning all matches</h3>

<p>
The current code terminates after finding the first possible match. With
recursive matching, this is the reason why it sometimes fails to find
a match when it should.  To overcome the problem of missed matches,
and also to return more useful information, <code>match_pat</code>
could return a list of all matches.
</p>

<h3>Returning a path as well as a subtree</h3>

<p> As well as returning the subtree(s) explicitly, it is helpful if the
location of the subtree(s) within the whole tree is returned.  A location
within the tree is most easily specified with a list of numbers (the
path from the root), where [] means the whole tree, [1] means the first
subtree of the root node, [1,3] means the third subtree of that subtree,
et cetera.  You could either return (lists of) subtree-path pairs or
simply paths and provide code to extract a subtree given a path.  </p>

<h3>Returning mappings from query variables to subtrees</h3>

<p> For many more complex queries, we want to relate information in
one subtree to that in another.  For example, we may want to find
comments in a blog which have the same author as the original message.
To enable such queries it is helpful to be able to associate "query
variables" to different pattern nodes.  For example, we may want to say
let <code>M</code> be an element with a "message" tag and <code>C</code>
be an element within <code>M</code> with a "comment" tag.  If we can find
all such matches it is a simple matter to filter out the ones where the
"author" attribute is the same in <code>M</code> and <code>C</code>.
<code>match_pat</code> could return (for example) a list of matches,
where each match is a list of pairs made up of a query variable and
a subtree (or path).  In order to include query variables in patterns, the
<code>Pat</code> type must be changed.  One possibility is to have
more complex <code>CheckElem</code> and <code>CheckText</code> types
which allow (possibly optional) query variables and return a Maybe type
instead of a Boolean.  For example, a patterm such as the one below may
be supported to express the query above:
</p>

<pre>
>pat4 = ElemPat any_seq (qvar "M" (has_tag "message"))
>       (Then (Then any_seq
>		(One (ElemPat any_seq (qvar "C" (has_tag "comment")) any_seq)))
>	any_seq)
</pre>

<h2>Marking scheme</h2>

<p> This project is worth 20 marks (20% of the overall assessment for
the subject).  You can obtain up to 6 marks for returning the subtree and
no other enhancements.  You can obtain up to 11 marks if you return all
matches (and avoid any missed matches).  You can get up to additional 6
marks (a total of 17) for returning paths as well as trees.  The final
3 marks will be allocated for support of query variables.  Project done
in pairs will be marked identically to projects done individually and
both student in the team will get the same mark.  </p>


<h2>Questions and answers</h2>

<p> Questions and answers pertaining to the project will primarily be on
the LMS discussion forum.  Any particularly important point will also be
put on <a href="./QandA.html">the web page</a> and will be considered
part of the specification of the project.  Questions about the project
are best asked in a workshop or the discussion forum.  </p>


<h2>Submission</h2>

<p> Submit your code and other files (see <a href="#task">above</a>)
using the command
</p>
<pre>
submit 326 2
</pre>
<p>
on a Computer Science machine by
<em>11:59pm on Friday, May 28</em>.
