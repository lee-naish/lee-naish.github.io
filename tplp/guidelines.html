I am honoured to be the co-editor of the
<em>Logic Programming Pearls</em> section of the journal
<A HREF="http://www.cs.kuleuven.ac.be/~dtai/projects/ALP/TPLP/index.html">
Theory and Practice of Logic Programming</A>.  Below are some brief
guidelines for submission of papers to this section.  Note that
submissions of pearls in logic programming languages other than Prolog
are welcome.  Functional programming language pearls,
although similar in spirit, are more appropriately
submitted to another journal such as
<A HREF="http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/jfp/">
The Journal of Functional Programming</A>.
<P>

A programming pearl is a short piece of self-contained code of
outstanding quality.  Ideally it should be clearly correct, elegant,
concise, efficient, et cetera, though in some cases a (small) subset of
these may not apply.  It may be a useful application or may
primarily be an example of a useful programming technique.
Portability is not so important in this context
but is expected if it can be achieved without sacrificing other
qualities.
<P>
Accompanying text explains the code and its qualities.  These may be
exposed by describing how a programmer could derive the code.
Ideally, a logic programming pearl should also showcase the logic
programming paradigm, for example, declarative semantics,
nondeterminism, logic variables, definite clause grammars, meta
programming and so forth.
<P>
The following classification may help clarify what is considered to be a
logic programming pearl.
<DL>
<DT> Natural Pearls
<DD> Like theorems in mathematics, natural pearls are discovered rather
than manufactured.  A logic program embodies a formulation of the
mathematical logic behind a problem.  This logic, plus a logic programming
interpreter, induces an algorithm to solve the problem.  Things of great
beauty can be formed from these elements.
<DT> Cultured Pearls
<DD> Cultured pearls are, in part, artifacts of our technology and are
regarded somewhat less highly than natural pearls.  They may depend on
some particular implementation technique such as the Warren Abstract
Machine or a specific language feature.
<DT> Black Pearls
<DD> Black pearls contain impurities but are still beautiful.
A program is not rejected as a pearl only on the grounds of
impurity.
<DT> Cut and Paste
<DD> Some artifacts may seem like pearls to the untrained eye but
can be distinguished by those of more refined taste.  The most ugly
scar on the face of Prolog programming is the abused <em>cut</em>. 
Using <code>goto</code> in C because you don't understand while loops 
is not a recipe for pearls.  Similarly, knowing when to use and not use
cut is a prerequisite for good Prolog programming.  A good reference for
Prolog programming is Richard O'Keefe's <em>The Craft of Prolog</em>
published by MIT Press.
