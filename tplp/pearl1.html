<H3>Abstract:</H3>
<DIV>This paper presents the development of a Prolog program which
illustrates many of the nice features of the language.  The application
is a <EM>meta-interpreter</EM> for Horn clauses, the basis of Prolog.  The
interpreter inherits <EM>nondeterminism</EM> and support for
<EM>logic variables</EM>
from the object program it is interpreting.  Logic variables are also
used in ``difference lists'' and the representation of the object
program.  The interpreter also uses <EM>definite clause grammar</EM>
notation and <EM>higher order</EM> programming.

Introduction</A>
</H1>

<P>
One aim of this paper is to showcase some of the programming techniques
available in pure Prolog.  Although the program presented consists of
only four clauses plus additional facts which represent the data the
program operates on, it illustrates a remarkably rich set of techniques.
An equally important aim is to show how Prolog can very elegantly
support abstraction in the program development process.  The ability to
support abstraction is a vital attribute of programming languages and
although Prolog has some weaknesses with abstract data types, in other
areas it can surpass other languages.

<P>

Prolog as graph searching</A>
</H1>

<P>
Prolog is based in the idea of resolution theorem proving.  A program
consists of Horn clauses and the execution uses resolution with these
clauses and a top-level goal.  The resolution strategy used (called
linear resolution) resolves the current goal with a program clause at
each step.  The process of solving the top-level goal (finding a
refutation) is an instance of graph searching, a familiar
abstraction used in artificial intelligence.
The search space can be seen as a graph, with nodes corresponding to
goals and edges corresponding to single resolution steps.  A refutation
corresponds to a path from the top-level goal to the empty goal.
Using another abstraction, the transitive closure operation on graphs,
we arrive at a concise specification of the solvability relation in
Prolog: a goal is solvable if and only if there is an edge from
(the node corresponding to)
that goal to the empty goal in the transitive closure of resolution step
relation.  This view of Prolog is the basis for our meta interpreter.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00030000000000000000">
The code</A>
</H1>

<P>
Some decisions about representation need to be made before any code is
written.  We use lists to represent (conjunctive) goals, <code>[]</code>
representing the empty goal.  Our meta interpreter will include a
representation of the program to be interpreted rather than having the
program as an argument.  We will use <code>resolvant/2</code> for the
single resolution step relation: <code>resolvant(G0,G)</code> is true if goal
<code>G</code> can be obtained by resolving goal <code>G0</code> with a single
program clause.  We defer discussion on our coding of transitive closure
until the end.  For now we just mention we will use a higher order style
of code and that <code>tc(resolvant,G0,G)</code> holds if there is an edge from
<code>G0</code> to <code>G</code> in the transitive closure of <TT>resolvant</TT>.

<P>
We can now code the top level of our interpreter.
Note that at this point the only commitment is that linear resolution
is used.  The resolution steps could use any computation (atom
selection) rule and the transitive closure algorithm could use any
clause selection rule and any combination of top-down, bottom-up and
memoing execution.

<P>
<PRE>
% meta interpreter for goal (=list)
solvable(G) :-
        tc(resolvant, G, []).
</PRE>
<P>
Standard Prolog uses a left to right computation rule so <TT>resolvant/2</TT>
resolves the <EM>first</EM> of a list of subgoals with a program clause.  The
result is the body of the (renamed) matching clause appended with the rest
of the subgoals, with a unifying substitution applied.  Potentially costly
renaming, unification, substitution and append operations can be done
very efficiently by the procedure which represents the object program,
so our coding of <TT>resolvant/2</TT> simply separates the first subgoal
and calls our version of <TT>clause</TT>.

<P>
<PRE>
% resolves first (Prolog choice) atom in goal with a clause
resolvant([G0|Gs0], Gs) :-
        dlclause(G0, Gs0, Gs).
</PRE>
<P>
Our clause representation is a familiar one, see [<A
 HREF="tplp.html#rok">O'Keefe, 1990</A>] for
example.  By using a non-ground clause representation
we take advantage of Prolog's built-in renaming, unification
and substitution of logic variables which are implemented very
efficiently at the core of most Prolog systems.
Appending is avoided by using ``difference lists'',
another use of logic variables.  Declaratively,
<TT>dlclause(Head, Cont, BodyCont)</TT> is true if there is a program
clause instance <TT>Head:-Body</TT> such that
<TT>append(Body, Cont, BodyCont)</TT>.  Note that in a logical sense we
don't distinguish between clauses and their instances.  The
representation is therefore rather limited (for example, we can't code
<TT>var/1</TT> in a logical way), but is sufficient for a pure
meta-interpreter with a simple computation rule.  We give the
representation of the naive reverse program as an example.

<P>
<PRE>
% dlclause uses difference lists for clause bodies
dlclause(app([], As, As), Cont, Cont).
dlclause(app([A|As], Bs, [A|Cs]), Cont, [app(As, Bs, Cs) | Cont]).
%
dlclause(rev([], []), Cont, Cont).
dlclause(rev([A|As], Bs), Cont,
        [rev(As, Cs), app(Cs, [A], Bs) | Cont]).
</PRE>
<P>
All that is needed now is our transitive closure implementation but we
first briefly discuss the higher order coding style we use.
The interpreter first appeared
(with minor differences) in [<A
 HREF="tplp.html#naish:ho">Naish, 1996</A>], which discussed higher
order programming more extensively.
A graph can be represented by its edge relation/predicate. In a true
higher order logic language this would be a first class object and
could be passed as an argument et cetera.  In our code we represent
the graph by the <EM>name</EM> of the predicate, the Prolog constant
<code>resolvant/0</code> (we just drop the two arguments which are vertices).
Similarly, the transitive closure is another graph and can be represented as
the term <TT>tc(resolvant)</TT>.

<P>
Our transitive closure predicate, <code>tc/3</code>, can be thought of as a
higher order predicate but can be given first order semantics since its
first argument is the symbolic name of a predicate, not an actual
predicate.  This style gives all the power of higher order programming
(it actually gives slightly too much power since comparing predicate
names is possible but dubious: <TT>tc(resolvant)</TT> and
<TT>tc(tc(resolvant))</TT> represent
the same predicate but the names are different).
The typical way such names are mapped to predicates in this style of
programming is via <TT>call/3</TT> (or <TT>call/N</TT> in general),
a built-in or library predicate in many Prolog systems.  It calls its first
argument (the name of a predicate) with the two additional arguments.
For example, <TT>call(resolvant,G0,G)</TT> calls <TT>resolvant(G0,G)</TT>.
The Definite Clause Grammar support predicate <TT>phrase/3</TT> is
equivalent in such cases.

<P>
Given a graph represented by edge predicate <I>E</I> the transitive closure
<I>tc</I>(<I>E</I>) is the <EM>path</EM> (a sequence of edges) predicate for <I>E</I>.
Prolog's support for Definite Clause Grammars is often very
convenient for programming with sequences and defining a path as being
empty or an edge followed by a path leads directly to the
following code:

<P>
<PRE>
% transitive closure of edge relation E (sequence of edges)
tc(E) --&gt; [].
tc(E) --&gt; E, tc(E).
</PRE>
<P>
For some DCG preprocessors the non-terminal <TT>E</TT>
must be replaced by <TT>phrase(E)</TT> or <TT>call(E)</TT>; in others
this is done automatically as part of the DCG expansion, which produces
the following Horn clauses:

<P>
<PRE>
tc(E, A, A).
tc(E, A, C) :- phrase(E, A, B), tc(E, B, C).
</PRE>
<P>
This is the most naive transitive closure algorithm and is very
inefficient in general.  However, combined with the code above it
corresponds to the standard Prolog execution strategy: naive
backtracking search.  The nondeterministic selection of an edge in the
graph is done by calling <TT>resolvant/2</TT> (via <TT>phrase/3</TT>)
which calls <TT>dlclause/3</TT> to select a clause matching the first
subgoal of the current goal.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00040000000000000000">
Discussion</A>
</H1>

<P>
The high level abstract ideas behind this view of Prolog translate to
code very directly and concisely.  The structure of the code clearly
separates the computation rule (encapsulated by <TT>resolvant/2</TT>)
and search strategy (encapsulated by <TT>tc/3</TT>).  This is made
possible by the use of higher order programming.  The coding emphasises
the simplicity of the Prolog search strategy by exposing the naive
transitive closure algorithm.

<P>
The transitive closure definition is a particularly nice example of
using abstractions.  The abstraction of definite clause grammar notation
is used to define a sequence.  The elements of the sequence are also
abstract entities: edges in a graph which have no explicit
representation in the program.  Furthermore, edges are defined by a
predicate but this predicate is a parameter rather than being specified
concretely.

<P>
By substituting different transitive
closure algorithms it is possible to simulate other
search strategies such as use of memoing (saving lemmas) and bottom-up
(forward chaining).  For example, simply swapping the two calls in the
<TT>tc/3</TT> definition (equivalent to changing the computation rule)
results in quite different behaviour.  The interpreter then uses a naive
bottom-up evaluation which generates provable goals in order of the
length of the proof, until the top level goal is matched.  That is,
instead of a top-down depth first search it uses a bottom-up iterative
deepening search.  Although very inefficient and never finitely failing,
this interpreter has the advantage of being complete, always finding a
proof if one exists.

<P>
The symmetric top-down iterative deepening (complete and reasonably
efficient) and bottom-up depth first (very inefficient and incomplete)
strategies can be obtained in two ways.  The more subtle way is by
replacing the recursive rule for <TT>tc</TT> by <TT>tc(E)-&gt;tc(E),E</TT>
(using the left-recursive simple definition of a sequence of edges).
A more obvious alternative is to keep the same transitive closure
algorithm but use it to search for a path from the empty goal to the top
level goal in a version of the graph with all edges reversed.  This can
be done by replacing the top level call to <TT>tc/3</TT> by
<TT>tc(converse(resolvant),[],G)</TT>, where <TT>converse</TT> can be
defined as follows (preferably in some standard library):

<P>
<PRE>
converse(Pred, X, Y) :- call(Pred, Y, X).
</PRE>
<P>
The code structure does impose some runtime overheads compared to some
other codings.  Specifically, the constants <TT>resolvant</TT> and
<code>[]</code> are passed around and <TT>phrase/3</TT> is used rather than
calling <TT>resolvant/2</TT> directly.  Using partial evaluation
techniques such as ``constant folding'' such overheads can be eliminated
(some Prolog compilers, for example XSB-Prolog, implement constant
folding specifically for higher order code).  For example, the Mixtus
partial evaluator [<A
 HREF="tplp.html#sahlin">Sahlin, 1993</A>] (with some minor tweaking of our code)
produces the following program.

<P>
<PRE>
solvable(A) :-
        solvable1(A).

solvable1(A) :-
        tcresolvant1(A).

% tcresolvant1(A):-tc(resolvant,A,[])
tcresolvant1([]).
tcresolvant1([A|B]) :-
        dlclause(A, B, C),
        tcresolvant1(C).
</PRE>
<P>
The structured way we developed the program is no longer reflected in
the code.  There is no longer a clear separation of the search strategy
from the computation rule, for example.  However, the code is
essentially equivalent to the most efficient meta interpreter in [<A
 HREF="tplp.html#rok">O'Keefe, 1990</A>].
We conclude with a top-down iterative deepening meta
interpreter developed with the help of Mixtus applied to the code we
have described above (<TT>tc1/3</TT> is the same as <TT>tc/3</TT> except
the two calls are swapped).  This is both significantly simpler and more
efficient than other such interpreters the author is aware of.
