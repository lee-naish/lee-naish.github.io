<H1>Want to offset your personal climate-inaction guilt?</H1>

<p>
Buy some carbon offsets - thats what they are for! 
Compare and contrast these two scenarios:
<ol>
<li> You miss out on your much needed overseas vacation and take a less
interesting (ie, fewer likes on social media) holiday closer to home -
Oh no!  Meanwhile, farmer Brown executes a previously conceived plan to
chop down lots of trees and burn them - Boo, Hiss!
<li> You take that overseas vacation (Yay!) but buy carbon offsets from some
company that passes on (some of) the money to farmer Brown, who promises
to not chop down the trees - Double Yay!
</ol> 
</p>

<p> In scenario 1, farmer Brown adds greenhouse gas when the planet
is already facing catastrophic climate change and should feel guilty.
In scenario 2, you have paid for offsets so your guilt is transferred
to whoever accepted the money, farmer Brown again - how convenient!
Farmer Brown may not <em>feel</em> guilty. The trees have on the farm
have been saved forever, for the benefit of humanity - something to be
proud of, one would think. Guilt is easy to get rid of but hard to
accept and there is a tendency for it to magically disappear during
carbon offset transactions.
</p>

<H1>Want to reduce climate catastrophe?</H1>

<p> Thats a <em>very</em> different question (and if you want to
<em>avoid</em> climate catastrophe, it's too late). Both scenarios are
<em>equally bad</em> as far as greenhouse gas emissions are concerned.
However, whenever you make a decision you should consider the risk that
things do not turn out as expected.  If you choose scenario 1, you can't
be sure that farmer Brown will actually chop down the trees. It's even
possible the "plan" was created <em>only</em> to get carbon offsets, with
no intention to be carried out. If you choose scenario 2, it's possible
the trees will be burnt anyway.  Farmer Brown may not keep his word or
there may be a bush-fire (then we can blame God!), for example. There is
no doubt: if you want to reduce climate catastrophe scenario 1 is the
right choice.
</p>

<H1>What about <em>planting</em> trees instead?</H1>

<p> Sure, we could change scenario 2 so the carbon offset company pays
farmer Brown to plant trees instead.  Planting trees is a good thing -
as they grow they take carbon out of the atmosphere.  However, that takes
<em>decades</em> whereas burning fossil fuels produces greenhouse gases
<em>immediately</em>.  It's like putting your foot on the accelerator
while promising to gradually apply the brakes in the future. To reduce
climate catastrophe we must take out foot off the accelerator and apply
the brakes <em>now</em>. As before, there is also the risk that the
trees won't grow or they burn down in a bush-fire. In addition, the trees
will no doubt be planted where there were once trees, chopped down by
farmer Brown senior some time ago.  All that is happening is that we are
(eventually) replacing the trees that were once there, but also burning
fossil fuels. This modified scenario 2 still leads us down the path of
climate catastrophe - all the science tells us fossil fuels need to stay
(mostly) in the ground.
</p>

<H1>What about a solar or wind farm instead?</H1>

<p> Again, we could change scenario 2 so the carbon offsets help
fund renewable energy production on farmer Brown's land. Like planting
trees, it's a good thing but it doesn't make any <em>immediate</em>
difference. And it doesn't even take carbon out of the atmosphere in
the longer term.  It's like putting your foot on the accelerator while
promising to accelerate somewhat less in the future. Sadly, I see no
version of scenario 2 that makes it the right choice.  At best, offsets
just shift blame while making no difference to emissions.  We are left
with scenario 1, in which we must change our lifestyle so it is more
sustainable.
</p>

<H1>But I have solar panels on <em>my</em> roof!</H1>

<p> Good on you! But it's very likely (in Australia at least) you
accepted all the subsidies and discounts when you had them installed;
they may not have even been itemised in the quote.  If so, you have essentially
<em>sold</em> carbon offsets (Small-scale Technology Certificates) to
big polluting companies to allow them to emit more greenhouse gasses
(the same occurs if you buy a subsidised hot water system or various
other energy-efficient appliances). You have lower power bills but, by
the magic of offsets, the big polluters have shifted their guilt to you,
just like shifting your guilt to farmer Brown in scenario 2.  When your
solar panels feed electricity into the grid, or even power your fridge,
it is offsetting emissions by big polluters - they have the certificates
to prove it.  Like farmer Brown, you may even feel some pride and think
your lifestyle is more sustainable but in reality you are helping support
emissions from big polluters. If you want your rooftop solar to make a
real difference to emissions, don't sell those certificates.
</p>

<H1>But I'm fighting to change <em>the system</em>!</H1>

<p> Again, good on you! The system <em>must</em> be changed so the most
environmentally damaging behaviours of humanity are curtailed. But at
least for the foreseeable future, regular flights overseas will remain
unsustainable. There is no current alternative to fossil fuel for this
style of transport.  It is a lifestyle that is incompatible with climate
stability. The system could change so it is illegal to fly more than a
certain amount, or taxation could be used to make it unaffordable for
you to do so, forcing you to choose scenario 1 (and perhaps stopping
farmer Brown from chopping down those trees as well). Sadly, the system
has not yet changed.  But the good news is, you don't have to wait for
system change to force you to choose scenario 1.  You can choose it now!
And we have a better chance of getting a (somewhat) democratic government
to introduce policies that limit flying if more people voluntarily do
so.
</p>

<p> I share your frustration at the lack of climate action shown
by governments, locally and globally.  Countries <em>refuse to limit
emissions until others do</em>, or worse, the USA has just withdrawn from
the Paris agreement.  In the moral wasteland of politics, influence and
economic advantage trump any notion of the common good and what is right.
We applauded Greta's moving speeches and hate the "Blah, Blah, Blah"
of the regular climate conferences, full of talk but little action.
We need climate <em>action</em> now, not just more talk.  But fighting to
change the system is not climate action. Even breaking the law and getting
arrested may be an "action" but it is not climate action. However loud
you shout at a rally, it is <em>talk</em>, not action.  If you are not
<em>acting</em> to change your behaviour and reduce your carbon footprint,
can you really claim the moral high ground above the politicians and
negotiators we criticise? I think not.
We hate "Drill, baby, drill" - it is utterly selfish - but the other side
of the same coin is "Fly, baby, fly". There is no point in drilling for
oil if there is nobody willing to buy it. By waiting for the system to
force you to change your behaviour, you <em>refuse to limit emissions
until others do</em> - sound familiar?  The system <em>is</em> changing,
but we need it to change more and faster.  Our behaviour is also changing,
but we need it to change more and faster as well.
</p>

<H1>Who is this farmer Brown anyway?</H1>

<p> It seems farmer Brown (and the whole Brown family) should shoulder
the guilt in all the scenarios, are quite likely to be dishonestly
rorting the system put in place to protect the planet and are possible
arsonists as well.  Even worse, they have ruined our holidays! I would
be tempted to get a few pitchforks and torches, gather some mates and
pay them all a visit, but I'm worried I may have slightly overstated
how evil they are and it turns out they live inconveniently far away.
In fact, the brown family live a different country.  They are very poor
compared to you and me (not even in the richest 10% of people in the
world - no wonder we don't know them).  They didn't profit much from
chopping down those trees in the past. The main beneficiaries were
rich folk living in countries like ours.  They have only contributed a
fraction of what we have contributed to global heating, but they are also
the ones likely to suffer the most. By pursuing our own selfishness
we inflict more pain and suffering on the residents of this planet,
particularly those with far few resources than we enjoy.
</p>

<H1>Addendum</H1>

<p> I wrote this partly because of my long-standing scepticism of carbon
offsets but more due to a growing frustration and sadness about how
nearly all my friends and family continue to behave. My heart says they
are not bad people. They are my friends. Maybe they are ignorant or in
denial but my logical (and seemingly neuro-divergent) brain cannot help
but think that their behaviour is utterly selfish and irresponsible.
Nearly all of them are aware of the unfolding climate catastrophe and
believe strong action is urgently needed. Several would be considered
climate activists.  Many have spent money to try to make their lives
more "green", such as installing rooftop solar or driving cars that
are less polluting.  Yet few of them have changed their lifestyle.
My heart sinks every time I hear that yet another friend will be flying
overseas for a holiday, or to visit family, or ride a bike, or whatever
- the impact is the same.  Several years ago there was pressure on me
to travel overseas with a couple of family members. I calculated that
joining them would have had an impact equivalent to almost three years
of our entire household electricity consumption from the grid, assuming
it was all generated using dirty brown coal.  It's one of the worst decisions
anyone can make for the planet and all its inhabitants.
</p>

<p> I'm not perfect. In the past I was flying to overseas conferences
most years.  I still occasionally drive a car and I'm not even a vegan.
I feel I should do more but I'm no longer prepared to be arrested (and
don't think it's particularly effective) and have run out of rooftops to
put solar panels on.  One thing I can do more is try to influence people.
It's challenging to confront people about their behaviour but by creating
this page I can share a link.  The best time to change our ways was over
thirty year ago, but the best still-possible time to change is now. If I
can convince just one person to avoid one overseas trip I will consider
this page to be a success - it will have achieved more than all my
attendances at climate rallies.  If I can convince two people then I'll
use that as an offset for an overseas trip! Hey, I'm kidding, alright -
I believe there is always a place for humour.
