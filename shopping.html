<H1>Lee's Shopping Page (or how to solve the world's problems)</H1>
<strong>The solution to every problem is "Lets go shopping!"</strong>
<UL>
<LI> I'm having a bad hair day.
<br>... Lets go shopping!
<LI> Millions of people are dying from easily preventable diseases.
<br>... Lets go shopping!
<LI> The earth's natural environment is being destroyed.
<br>... Lets go shopping!
</UL>
<strong>... if only it was true.</strong>

<P>
Some time ago (in 1999) I recieved an e-mail telling me about
<A HREF="http://www.thehungersite.com">
The Hunger Site </A>, where you can help feed the
hungry simply by browsing the site.  By following the links to daily
sponsors, these sponsors donate money to help feed the starving masses.
I dutifully did this but felt uneasy.  Somehow there seemed to be a
contradiction.
<P>
More recently I was told about 
<A HREF="http://www.therainforestsite.com">
The Rainforest Site</A>, which uses a similar mechanism to
save tropical rainforest.  Both sites are run by 
<A HREF="http://www.GreaterGood.com">Greater Good</A>.  This prompted me
to put my analysis on a Web page, something I had resolved to do
previously but had not got around to it.
<P>
<strong>If you are part of the solution you are part of the problem
<br>
... Doh!</strong>
<P>
Just how is surfing the internet able to generate money to help
solve the world's problems?  On the face of it, its rather miraculous.
The answer is, of course, advertising.
Companies are willing to pay huge amounts of money to advertise their
products.  They don't care where the money goes to, as long as they get
good value for it.  If some goes to unquestionably worthy causes all the
better for the image of the company, and they may even believe in these
causes.
<P>
Just how is advertising able to generate money for companies to increase
their profits?  On the face of it, its rather miraculous than some very
successful companies spend far more on advertising their products than
actually making them.  The answer lies in those good friends capitalism
and consumerism.  Individually, companies increase their market share
(compared to their competitors) by advertising.  It is often a more
attractive alternative to making their products better or less costly.
Collectively, companies increase the size of their market by advertising.
<P>
Just how are capitalism and consumerism part of the problems of extreme
poverty and environmental degradation?  Its no miracle that as markets
and economies grow, rainforests shrink.  Its no miracle that as
directors of companies try to maximise profits, the poor of the world
become more poor.
<P>
But they seem to be <em>nice</em> companies who advertise there, and I
don't intend to buy any products anyway, so visiting these sites does
some good and no harm, doesn't it?
<P>
It does a pitiful amount of good.  When I visited The Hunger Site a
fraction of a cent was donated for each "hit" on a sponsor (also a
fraction of the going rate for hits on advertisers on the internet).
If you visited once every day (the maximum allowed), you would generate a few
dollars donation in a year at most.  Internet Service Providers are
likely to benefit far more than starving people.  And in the mean time,
how much have you spent on products whose manufacture involves
exploitation of the third world?  How much were the workers paid to make
your clothes and your shoes and for assembling components of your computer?
If visiting The Hunger Site makes you <em>think</em> you are doing
significant good then its actually doing harm.
<P>
Sorry to disappoint you all, but it takes more than surfing the Web
to undo a fraction of the harm we are all constantly causing as we
consume in the way we are accustomed to.  You would do far more good to
support an organisation such as <A HREF="http://www.caa.org.au/">
Community Aid Abroad - Oxfam Australia</A>.
