<h2>Note</h2>

As from the start of December 2013 I stopped paid work (I
have no teaching or admin duties - if you think I'm the right
person to contact, think again) and was diagnosed with a <a
href="http://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/lee/pc/first.html">terminal
illness</a>, which amplifies the following old message.  As from
the start of March 2000 I have been working half time due to <a
href="http://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/lee/cfs.html">health reasons</A>.
Unfortunately, my e-mail load didn't immediately drop by half and it is a
major obstacle to getting other work done.  In addition, I have become a
<a href="http://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/lee/images/jasmine/">father</A>,
causing somewhat of an <a
href="http://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/lee/email.txt"> e-mail backlog</A>
amongst other things.  So, please direct enquiries as below.  If you
do send me e-mail, make sure the subject line and start don't look like
spam - my "delete without looking further" threshold has been lowered.

<h2>Research Interests</h2>

Ever since I was an undergraduate Computer Science student I have been
fascinated by reasoning about <em>program correctness</em>, and this
has been a central theme of my research ever since.  It can be summed
up by the following question.
<blockquote>
How can we clarify the relationships between what
we want a computer to do (which is in our head), the programs we write
(syntactic objects), and what they make a computer do (a sequence of
execution states, hopefully ending up with what we wanted)?
</blockquote>
This has naturally lead to an interest in <em>declarative programming
languages</em>: topics such as programming language design and
implementation, declarative debugging (reasoning about
<em>in</em>correctness) and semantics.
<p>

I have also worked on debugging using program spectra (eg. data on what
statements are executed in each of a set of passed or failed tests). This
has lead to an interest in <em>set similarity</em>. For debugging,
we expect the set of test cases which fail to be "similar" to the set
of test cases which execute a buggy statement (more similar than for
correct statements at least).  More than a hundred different ways of
measuring set similarity have been used and it is an important problem
throughout science and is a special case for <em>machine learning</em>
and <em>data mining</em>.
<p>

Other interests have included algorithm animation (the Algorithms In
Action system), information economics and vote counting.  Since I took
up road cycling my physical fitness has improved but my research output
has dropped considerably.  However, I'm still very keen to get
what I think are some important ideas published, preferable with co-authors.

<P>
Interesting?  You might like to take a look at some of my
<ul>
<li><a href="./papers/">papers</A> or
<li><a href="./src/">software</A>, including the
<a href="./src/pawns/">
Pawns programming language</a>
and
<a href="./papers/adtpp/">
Adtpp</a>
(the rest is very old stuff mostly related to NU-Prolog).
</ul>
The list of papers is sometimes a bit out of date.
If you are a prospective PhD student I would be glad to hear from you,
but please be as specific as possible about what research topic you are
interested in.  Also, due to my health status it will be necessary for you to
find a co-supervisor and for a while now I've been spending a lot more time
riding my bikes than doing academic work, so I'm getting a bit left behind with
the lastest research.

<h2>Administration</h2>
I was once the best
<a href="http://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/lee/privacy/">Privacy Liaison Officer</A>
our department had ever
had.  I'm not sure if that role still exists and
I am still looking forward to the time when we have a
web page listing who is responsible for what in the department.

<P>
I also put in a <a href="http://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/lee/facreview.html">submission</A>
to the 2005/2006 Review of the Faculty of Engineering.

looking a bit dated - I guess I should upgrade it from HTML version 2.0
to Java/XML/...
Gosh, even that meta-joke is getting outdated - I should be using Web 2.0
technologies so <strong>you</strong> can update and discuss what is or
should be currently in my pocket and I can spend my ample spare time reading
it.
How the world changes! Even that meta-meta-joke is now outdated - my Web 3.0
AI system should be recommending what should be in my pocket based on whatever
you are selling (assuming you are a paying customer), sending me notifications
and asking if they are useful or not.

<hr>
<A NAME="regulations">Due to ammendment number 73 of 1996 of
Regulation 8.1.R7 of The University of
Melbourne I am compelled to include the following fascinating information:</A>
<ul>
<li>This page, its contents and style, are the resposibility of the author
and do not necessarily represent the views, policies or opinions of The
University of Melbourne.

<li>The same disclaimer applies for all my other computer files, technical
reports, papers, lecture notes, handouts, text and diagrams on
white boards, toilet walls, etc.

<li>The author of this page is
<a href="http://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/lee">Lee Naish</A>

<li>  This page was probably last updated around
Sun Aug 30 15:03:40 AEST 2020

but your browser should be able to provide <em>accurate</em> information
on modification dates.  As for when the content of the page were most
recently correct (if ever), who knows?
<li>I don't know when this page was created, boss, but it was certainly before
any regulations saying you had to include such information on pages.
 
<li>I hope "The University of Melbourne" is not a trademark of The
University of Melbourne, otherwise I'm in real strife.
 
<li>This section of this page, its contents and style,
do not necessarily represent the views, policies or opinions of The
Author.
 
<li> I used to have a Home Page but the regulations now say:
<blockquote>
A Home Page is the first single page, or point of contact, for a
Faculty, Department or Organisation.  The subsequent pages that the Home
Page leads to should simply be referred to as "pages".
</blockquote>
<P>
I wanted a Homme Page instead, but the the official booklet says to
avoid gender-specific speech and writing.
<P>
I considered a Noam page, but didn't want to question the authority
of the
<a href="http://www.zmag.org/chomsky/index.cfm">
official archive</A>.
<P>
I thought about an Ohm Page, but the faceless bureaucrat said
<strong>resistance is futile</strong>.
<P>
I dreamed about a Gnome Page, but was told they don't exist.
<P>
I meditated about an Om Page, but my mind went
<font color="#CACACA">blank</font>.
<P>
So, for now, I've settled for a non-Home Page.
