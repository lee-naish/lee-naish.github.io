We show how declarative (or algorithmic) debugging can be applied
to   lazy   functional   programming  and  describe  a  prototype
implementation.  We first  present  a  declarative  debugger  for
logic programs which relies on three primitives that determine if
an atom is valid  in  the  intended  interpretation,  return  the
successful clause instance used by a call and return single atoms
from  a  conjunction  of  atoms.   By  simply   using   different
interpretations  and  versions  of  these  three  primitives  the
debugger can be used to locate errors in  strict  and  non-strict
functional  programs.   Debugging  strict code is essentially the
same as debugging Horn  clause  programs.   Debugging  non-strict
code  can result in questions containing unevaluated expressions.
These questions can be simplified by using quantified variables.
<P>

The prototype system is based on
<A HREF="../eq/">
NUE-Prolog
</A>,
which  supports  a
functional  language on top of NU-Prolog and is implemented using
the  flattening  transformation.   The  implementation  has  been
modified  so  functional  code  returns  a  representation of the
computation which is then passed  to  the  debugger.   The  basic
algorithm is applicable to other functional programming languages
also.

Keywords: functional programming,  lazy  evaluation,  declarative
debugging, logic programming.
