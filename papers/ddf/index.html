<h1>Declarative Diagnosis of Floundering in Prolog</h1>

<p>
Many logic programming languages have delay primitives which allow
coroutining. This introduces a class of bug symptoms - computations can
<em>flounder</em> when they are intended to succeed or finitely fail.
For concurrent logic programs this is normally called <em>deadlock</em>.
Similarly, constraint logic programs can fail to invoke certain constraint
solvers because variables are insufficiently instantiated or constrained.
Diagnosing such faults as received little attention to date.  Since
delay primitives affect the procedural but not the declarative view of
programs, it may be expected that debugging would have to consider the
often complex details of interleaved execution.  However, recent work on
semantics has suggested an alternative approach.  In this paper we show
how the declarative debugging paradigm can be used to diagnose unexpected
floundering, insulating the user from the complexities of the execution.
