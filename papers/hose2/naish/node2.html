Stepwise Enhancement for Program Construction</A>
</H1>

<P>
The method of stepwise enhancement  (Lakhotia, [<A
 HREF="node20.html#Lakhotia">Lak89</A>]) was originally
conceived as an adaptation of stepwise refinement to Prolog. It was
advocated as a way to systematically construct Prolog programs, which
exploits Prolog's high-level features. The key idea underlying stepwise
enhancement is to visualise a program or solution in terms of its central
control flow, or skeleton, and techniques  which perform computations while
the control flow of the skeleton is followed. Techniques can be developed
independently and combined automatically using the method of composition.

<P>
The most common data structure for logic programs is the list, and many
programs are based on skeletons for traversing lists. A tutorial example of
using stepwise enhancement to develop a simple program is given in Chapter
13 of (Sterling and Shapiro, [<A
 HREF="node20.html#Sterling94">SS94</A>]). In this section we give the basic list
processing program as Program 1 for reference, and a (slightly) more
elaborate example with binary trees.

<P>
Programs 2a and 2b are skeleton programs for traversing binary trees with
values only at leaf nodes (later we also use M-way trees with data
in internal nodes). Program 2a, the left-hand program, does a
complete traversal of the tree, while Program 2b, the right-hand program,
traverses a single branch of the tree. Note that Program 2a can be viewed
as a type definition of trees.

<P>

    is_tree(R).

<P>
Techniques capture basic Prolog programming practices, such as building a
data structure or performing calculations in recursive code. Informally, a
programming technique interleaves some additional computation around the
control flow of a skeleton program. The additional computation might
calculate a value or produce a side effect such as screen output.
Syntactically, techniques may rename predicates, add arguments to
predicates, add goals to clauses, and/or add clauses to programs. Unlike
skeletons, techniques are not programs but can be conceived as a family of
operations that can be applied to a program to produce a program.

<P>
A technique applied to a skeleton yields an <EM>enhancement</EM>. An
enhancement which preserves the computational behaviour of the skeleton
is called an <EM>extension</EM>.

<P>
We give examples of techniques. The two most commonly used techniques are
the calculate and build techniques. They both compute something, a value or
a data structure, while following the control flow of the skeleton. An
extra argument is added to the defining predicate in the skeleton, and an
extra goal is added to the body of each recursive clause. In the case of
the calculate technique, the added goal is an arithmetic calculation; in
the case of the build technique, the goal builds a data structure. In both
cases, the added goal relates the extra argument in the head of the clause
to the extra argument(s) in the body of the clause.  Note that the
terminology used in the stepwise enhancement literature tends to be
procedural.  Despite this, the resulting programs can be viewed in a
declarative way and (in some cases) are reversible.

<P>
Two typical examples of the application of the calculate technique
are given as Programs 3a and 3b. Both are extensions of Program 2a which
traverses a binary tree with values at its leaves. The left-hand program
(3a) computes the product of the values of the leaves of the trees. The
extra argument in the base case is the value of the leaf node. In the
recursive case, the extra goal says that the product of a tree is the
product of its left subtree and its right subtree. The predicate
<code>is_tree/1</code>
has been renamed to <code>prod_leaves/2</code>. The right-hand program (3b), which
computes the sum of the leaves, is very similar, the only difference being
choice of names and the extra goal.

<P>

     prod_leaves(R,RProd),             sum_leaves(R,RSum),
     Prod is LProd*RProd.              Sum is LSum+RSum.

technique
<BR>
<BR>

<P>
Two enhancements of the same skeleton share computational behaviour. They
can be combined into a single program which combines the functionality of
each separate enhancement. Techniques can be developed independently and
subsequently combined automatically. The (syntactic) operation for
combining enhancements is called <EM>composition</EM>.
This is similar in intent to
function composition where the functionality of separate functions are
combined into a single function. Program 4 is the result of the composition
of Programs 3a and 3b.

<P>
<PRE>
prod_sum_leaves(leaf(X),X,X).
prod_sum_leaves(tree(L,R),Prod,Sum) :-
     prod_sum_leaves(L,LProd,LSum),
     prod_sum_leaves(R,RProd,RSum),
     Prod is LProd*RProd,
     Sum is LSum+RSum.
</PRE><B>Program 4</B>:  The composition of two extensions
<BR>
<BR>

<P>
A different programming technique uses accumulators. The
accumulator-calculate technique adds two arguments to the defining
predicate in the skeleton. The
first argument is used to record the current value of the variable in
question and the second contains the final result of the computation. The
base case relates the input and output arguments, usually via unification.
One difference between calculate and accumulate-calculate is in the need to
add an auxiliary predicate. Another is that goals and initial values need
to be placed differently.

<P>
Program 5 shows the result of applying the accumulate-calculate technique
to the tree traversal program, Program 2a. It computes the sum of the
leaves of a binary tree and is comparable to Program 3b. In general,
programs written with accumulator techniques will run more efficiently than
the equivalent program written with calculate and build techniques, due to
the way tail recursion is implemented in Prolog.

<P>

    Sum is Accum + X.

    accum_sum_leaves(R,Accum1,Sum).

<P>
Program 6 is an example of the application of the accumulate-build
technique, also applied to Program 2a. It builds an inorder traversal of
the leaves of the tree. There is no explicit arithmetic calculation, rather
lists built by unification in the base clause. There is one subtlety here.
Accumulators build structures in reverse order and hence the right subtree
is traversed before the left subtree in order to have the final list in the
correct order.  With commutative operations such as addition for
integers the order is immaterial.

The skeletons and techniques presented in this paper are all taken from
Prolog, but stepwise enhancement is equally applicable to other logic
programming languages, as discussed in Kirschenbaum, Michaylov and Sterling
([<A
 HREF="node20.html#Kirschenbaum">KMS96</A>]).
They claim that skeletons and techniques should be identified when
a language is first used, in order to encourage systematic, effective
program development. This learning approach should be stressed during
teaching. They show that the skeletons and techniques for Prolog can be
extended to constraint logic programming languages, notably CLP(<IMG
 WIDTH="21" HEIGHT="18" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img1.gif"
 ALT="${\cal R}$">),
concurrent logic programming languages such as Flat Concurrent Prolog and
Strand, and higher order logic program languages, in particular <IMG
