Non-deterministic Skeletons</A>
</H2>

<P>
Algebraic types correspond to RUL programs, in which predicates are
deterministic and only have a single argument.  The stepwise enhancement
paradigm has no such restriction, hence nondeterministic skeletons such as
<code>branch/1</code> (Program 2b) and <code>connected/2</code> (Program 9)
can be used.

connected(A0, A) :-
    edge(A0, A1),
    connected(A1, A).

<BR> 

<P>
As noted in (Naish, [<A
 HREF="node20.html#Naish">Nai96</A>]), higher order logic programs can also be
nondeterministic and nondeterministic analogues of <code>foldr</code> can be
constructed.  A version of <code>foldr</code> for paths in a graph was
written (using considerable intellectual effort) based on the simple
transitive closure procedure <code>connected/2</code>, above.
The close relationship between ``shape'' and stepwise enhancement we have
uncovered can be used to generalise the transformation from algebraic
types (or RUL programs) to <code>foldr</code> functions.  From an arbitrary skeleton
(not necessarily a RUL program), we can generate an appropriate version
of <code>foldr</code> as follows.

<P>
=1pc0
 <I>Definition<I> 
6.1.</I></I>(foldr transformation)
A procedure with <EM>A</EM> arguments and <EM>C</EM> clauses leads to a
higher order procedure with <EM>C+A+1</EM> arguments.  It has <EM>C</EM>
``higher order'' arguments and one additional ``result'' argument.  The
recursive calls in the clause bodies have the same higher order arguments
as the head and new variables for their results.  Each clause also has an
additional <code>call/N</code> with the higher order argument for that
clause, the variables in the head which did not appear in any recursive body
calls, result arguments of the body calls and the result argument of the
head.  If this call has only two arguments then <code>call/2</code> is
replaced by <code>=/2</code> (the higher order argument is simply a term
which is returned for the base case; the call to <code>=/2</code> can then be
optimised away, as in Program 7).
<P>
 
<P>
Mutual recursion can be treated in the same way.  Each procedure in a
set of (mutually recursive) procedures is transformed as above, where
<EM>C</EM> is the number of clauses in the set of procedures.  In the
description of the transformation above and other
transformations in Section <A HREF="node14.html#newtrfs">8</A> we refer to ``recursive'' calls.
This should be interpreted as including mutual recursion when
transforming multiple procedures.  Our implementation of the tools
introduced in Section <A HREF="node13.html#tools">7</A> has been made more flexible by using
an even more liberal definition: a call to any procedure defined in the
input to the tool is considered recursive and <EM>C</EM> is the number of
clauses defined in procedures indirectly called by a specified procedure.

<P>
For <code>list/1</code> and <code>tree/1</code> the results are the
<code>foldr/4</code> and <code>foldrbt/4</code> definitions given in
Programs 7 and 8.  For <code>branch/1</code> and <code>connected/2</code>
the results are in Program 10.  The <code>foldrcon/5</code> procedure here is
actually more general than the manually constructed version (which had
a base case of <code>V=FB</code> instead of <code>call/3</code>) and
can be used in the applications described in (Naish, [<A
 HREF="node20.html#Naish">Nai96</A>]).
Section <A HREF="node7.html#sumsquare">6.1</A> gives an example where a call is needed in the
base case.
