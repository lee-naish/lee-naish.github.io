Conclusions</A>
</H1>

<P>
Research into systematic program construction has the important aim of
elevating coding from the realm of arts and entertainment to science and
engineering.  In this paper we have built a bridge between the pragmatic
syntax-based approach of stepwise enhancement and the very theoretical
semantic approach of shape and polytypism.  Despite the gulf between the
research methodologies behind these two approaches, there is a very close
relationship between them.  This is pleasing in itself but also allows us
to see ways in which both approaches can be generalised.

<P>
From the work on shape and polytypism in functional languages we have the
generality of arbitrary functions as parameters, polymorphic types and the
automatic synthesis of certain higher order functions from algebraic types.
From the work on stepwise enhancement in logic programming, we have the
generality of nondeterminism, additional arguments, flexible modes and use
of accumulators.  By combining the advantages of both approaches, we have
shown how more code in both functional and logic programming languages can
be constructed in a systematic and partially automated way.  Initial
experiences with prototype tools based on these ideas have been very
encouraging.
