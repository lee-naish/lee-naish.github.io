Foldl</A>
</H2>

<P>
In many cases, the higher order function <code>foldl</code> is preferable to
<code>foldr</code> since it is tail recursive rather than left recursive
(and thus may be more efficient, at least for strict evaluation).
Note that the complexity of <code>foldl</code> can actually be worse in some
cases (depending on the operation) and if the operation is not
associative the result of using <code>foldl</code> will generally be different
from that using <code>foldr</code>.  It is not
immediately obvious how to adapt <code>foldl</code> to general tree types
rather than just lists.  One possibility, suggested by Barry Jay is to
perform a breadth first traversal (<code>foldr</code> uses a depth first
traversal).  This can be coded in a tail recursive fashion and is a
familiar programming technique.

<P>
Another possibility, which we pursued initially and is used in
(Belleannie et al [<A
 HREF="node20.html#Belleannie">BBR97</A>]),
is to use <code>foldr</code> with more complex data flow, using
logic variables.  The result argument of <code>foldr</code> can be a pair
of terms, one of which can be used as an input, and the accumulator
style of programming can be used.  If the accumulator is a list, we can
think of <code>foldr</code> returning a difference list
(Sterling and Shapiro, [<A
 HREF="node20.html#Sterling94">SS94</A>]) instead of a list.
With this style of programming, the data dependencies are such that
the instances of <code>call/N</code> in the <code>foldr</code> definitions can
be executed before the recursive call(s), allowing tail recursion.

<P>
However, we believe the most elegant and natural generalisation of
<code>foldl</code> is evident in the stepwise enhancement paradigm.
We adapted stepwise enhancement to produce higher order
<code>foldr</code> procedures using a generalisation of the calculate and
build techniques.  By using <EM>accumulator techniques</EM> we can produce
a <code>foldl</code> procedure for any skeleton.  Expert Prolog programmers
use accumulators much
more often than breadth first traversals and the code produced has
simple data flow and can be translated into a functional language if the
initial skeleton corresponds to an algebraic type.

<P>
=1pc0
 <I>Definition<I> 
6.2.</I></I>(foldl transformation)
The transformation is similar to the one described for <code>foldr</code>.
The same number of higher order arguments are used and there is one
output argument, as before, but there is also an extra accumulator
argument.  The <code>call/N</code> is the leftmost atom in the body and the
accumulator and output arguments are ``threaded'' through this and the
recursive calls in the clause body in the familiar way
(Sterling and Shapiro, [<A
 HREF="node20.html#Sterling94">SS94</A>]).
<P>
 
<P>
The accumulator and output arguments can be made implicit by using the
standard Definite Clause Grammar notation.  The resulting version of
<code>foldl</code> for lists is as follows.

<P>
<PRE>
% Explicit accumulator version
foldl(FC, FB, [], A0, A) :-            
    call(FB, A0, A).                  
foldl(FC, FB, [X|Xs], A0, A) :-        
    call(FC, X, A0, A1),            
    foldl(FC, FB, Xs, A1, A).      

% DCG (implicit accumulator) version
foldl(FC, FB, []) --&gt;
    call(FB).
foldl(FC, FB, [X|Xs]) --&gt;
    call(FC, X),
    foldl(FC, FB, Xs).
</PRE><B>Program 14</B>:  Automatically derived foldl for lists
<BR>
<BR>

<P>
There are two differences between this version of <code>foldl</code> and the
standard <code>foldl</code> for lists defined in functional programming languages.
The first is the argument order for
the call to the <code>FC</code> ``function'' is swapped.  This is not essential
but allows the accumulator and output arguments to be implicit using the
DCG notation.  It is also consistent with <code>foldr</code>.  The second
difference is the use of a function called in the base case.  The
standard version of <code>foldl</code> simply returns the accumulator when
the end of the list is reached.  This is equivalent to our version of
<code>foldl</code> with the identity function (<code>=/2</code> in Prolog) as
the function for the base case.

<P>
For data structure such as lists which are ``linear'' and have no data
in the (only) leaf,
calling a function when the base case is reached adds no real
power.  The function can always be called at the top level after
<code>foldl</code> has returned, with the same effect.  However, for tree
structures or linear structures with data in the leaf,
a function application at the base case is often essential.
Below are the versions of <code>foldl</code> for the <code>bt</code> type and
<code>connected/2</code> procedure.
Note <code>prod_leaves/2</code> (<code>sum_leaves/2</code>) has the
multiplication (addition) at the leaves, as in Program 5.
These predicates are equivalent to the previous versions, in
Program 8, if <code>plus/3</code> and <code>times/3</code> are associative.

<P>
<PRE>
foldlbt(F, B, leaf(X)) --&gt;              
    call(B, X).                        
foldlbt(F, B, t(L,R)) --&gt;             
    call(F),                         
    foldlbt(F, B, L),               
    foldlbt(F, B, R).              

prod_leaves(T, P) :-              
    foldlbt(=, times, T, 1, P).  
                                
sum_leaves(T, P) :-            
    foldlbt(=, plus, T, 0, P).

rev_traverse(Tree, Xs) :-
    foldlbt(=, cons, Tree, [], Xs).
</PRE>
<PRE>
foldlcon(F, B, A, A) --&gt;
    call(B, A).
foldlcon(F, B, A0, A) --&gt;
    call(F, A0),
    {edge(A0, A1)},
    foldlcon(F, B, A1, A).

% non-looping connected; returns path
con_no_loop(A0, A, As) :-
    foldlcon(cons_nm, cons, A0, A, [], As).

cons_nm(A0, As, [A0|As]) :-
    not member(A0, As).
</PRE><B>Program 15</B>:  Versions of foldl for <code>is_tree/1</code> and <code>connected/2</code>
<BR>

<P>
For <code>foldlcon/6</code>, the call to <code>edge/2</code> is not recursive, so
accumulator arguments are not added (braces are used to indicate this in
the DCG notation).
From <code>foldlcon/2</code> it is simple to code <code>con_no_loop/3</code> which finds
connected nodes but avoids cycles.  The accumulator is the list of nodes
visited so far, in reverse order. The procedure which adds a new node
to the accumulator, <code>cons_nm/3</code>, fails if the node is already on
the path.  The path is also be returned at the top level.

<P>
Since the skeleton <code>is_tree/1</code> is a RUL program and
hence equivalent to an algebraic type, <code>foldlbt/4</code> is
deterministic and behaves as a higher order function over that type.
The threading of the accumulator and result arguments in the body of a
clause is equivalent to nesting of functional expressions.
For comparison, we give the equivalent Haskell code in Program 16.

<P>
<PRE>
&gt;data Bt a = Leaf a | Tree (Bt a) (Bt a)
&gt;foldlbt :: (a-&gt;a)-&gt;(b-&gt;a-&gt;a)-&gt;(Bt b)-&gt;a-&gt;a
&gt;foldlbt f b (Leaf x) a = b x a
&gt;foldlbt f b (Tree l r) a =
&gt;    foldlbt f b r (foldlbt f b l (f a))

&gt;sum_leaves t = foldlbt (id) (+) t 0
</PRE><B>Program 16</B>:  Haskell version of foldl for is_tree/type bt
<BR>
<BR>

<P>
There are actually two possible versions of <code>foldlbt/5</code>, depending
on the order in which the two subtrees are visited.  By swapping the
two recursive calls in the DCG version, the argument threading is also
changed, leading to a logically different procedure.  The procedure
<code>rev_traverse/2</code> in Program 15 returns the reverse of the
traversal returned by Program 6.  Using the other version of
<code>foldlbt/5</code> would result in the same traversal order. The choice of
traversal orders and additional argument in <code>foldl</code>
are consistent with the intuition that programming with accumulators
or <code>foldl</code> is more complicated than
using simple recursion or <code>foldr</code>.
