A prototype tool to support the stepwise enhancement paradigm is
discussed in (Sterling and Sitt Sen [<A
 HREF="node20.html#Sterling93a">SS93</A>]).
Users interact with the tool to
construct an enhancement from one of several predefined skeletons.
The discussion in this paper on higher order programming and shape suggests three tools
to automate parts of the
software development process. The first converts types (defined in some
suitable syntax) into Horn clause definitions, the second converts Horn
clause definitions into related higher order predicate definitions and the
third optimises code to eliminate the overheads of higher order predicates
(see Figure 0).

<P>
Considering only the work on shape and polytypism
in functional languages it seems more natural go directly from types to
higher order functions.  However, splitting this into two separate stages
has significant advantages.  Having Horn clause definitions of types is
useful in itself for runtime type checks, test data generation et cetera.
These Horn clause definitions may also be refined by adding further
constraints, for example, refining the definition of a binary tree to
obtain the definition of a binary search tree.  Most importantly, it
allows higher order definitions to be derived from arbitrary Horn clause
programs, significantly increasing flexibility.

</PRE><B>Program 17</B>:  User input to tools
<BR> 

<P>
We have implemented prototypes of the first two tools and experimented with
a previously developed optimisation tool.  Program 17 gives a small example
of the use of our tools.  It contains the definition of the polymorphic
type <TT>tree</TT>, a directive which states that versions of <I>foldl</I> and
<I>foldr</I> should be generated for this type, and a use of <I>foldl</I> for this
type.  In a more tightly integrated system the need for explicit directives
could be avoided by detecting such uses of higher order predicates and
generating predicates based on usage.  The first tool takes the type
definition and generates Horn clause definitions of <TT>tree/2</TT> (a
higher order predicate corrresponding to the polymorphic type) and
<TT>tree_any/1</TT>.  The second tool takes the definition of
<TT>tree_any/1</TT> and produces Horn clause definitions of the higher
order predicates <TT>foldl_tree_any/5</TT> and
<TT>foldr_tree_any/4</TT>.  Existing tools/compilers can transform
<TT>sum_tree</TT> so it is as efficient as hand-optimised code.
We plan to implement a Web interface to the tools in the future.

<P>
Converting types into Horn clause definitions is conceptually
straightforward.  However, our implementation was made more complex by
allowing type synonyms and undescriminated unions in type definitions, and
the desire for the Horn clause definitions to be as simple as possible.
The simplicity of the output is important for the subsequent generation of
higher order predicates.  Our prototype needs more work to ensure the
simplest output is produced for all possible inputs.  Optimisation of
higher order code is also reasonably straightforward and has been done in
several logic programming systems, such as the compilers for XSB-Prolog
(Sagonas and Warren
[<A
 HREF="node20.html#Sagonas">SW95</A>]) and Mercury (Somogyi et al. [<A
 HREF="node20.html#Somogyi">SHC95</A>]).
Unfortunately, most
Prolog compilers do not perform such optimisations and there are no
available source to source optimisation tools which are guaranteed to work
correctly for standard Prolog.

<P>
Converting Horn clause definitions into higher order predicates requires
more innovation.  One challenge is taking a known transformation from
regular types to higher order functions and generalising it to Horn clause
definitions which may not correspond to regular types.  We have shown one
way to do this for <I>foldr</I> and developed a new generalisation of <I>foldl</I>,
but each transformation requires careful thought and there is not
necessarily a unique ``best'' solution.
Another challenge is determining a
<EM>useful</EM> set of transformations or abstractions.  An obvious starting
point is the functions over lists which have been found useful in
functional programming.  However, the optimal set depends on the
programming style and what programming patterns occur frequently.  Although
there are important programming patterns which lie in the intersection of
what is coded in logic and functional languages, there are also patterns
which are unique to each paradigm.
