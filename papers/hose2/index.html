<H1>Stepwise Enhancement and Higher Order Programming in Prolog</H1>

<H3>
			Lee Naish and Leon Sterling
</H3>
This paper presents two views of stepwise enhancement, one a pragmatic
syntax-based approach
and the other a semantic approach based on higher order functions and
relating to shape and
polytypism. The approaches are outlined, and the perhaps surprisingly
close relationship between
the two described. By combining the advantages of both approaches, it is
shown how more code in
both functional and logic programming languages can be constructed in a
systematic way. We
describe a prototype system which allows higher order predicate
definitions to be produced
automatically from type definitions or Horn clause skeletons and relate
some experiences in using
higher order programming in Prolog.
