<title>Declarative debugging</title>
<h1>Declarative debugging</h1>

Locating bugs in software is an unavoidable part of software
development.  Techniques are being developed which can dramatically
reduce the time and effort spent on debugging.
Traditional debugging techniques are based on the underlying
steps in the execution of a program.  With high level languages such as
logic programming languages the sequence of execution steps can be very
complex.  However, logic programs not only specify what
execution steps are performed; they also specify the logic behind the
steps.  This logical description of what is to be computed (as opposed
to how it is to be computed) is the basis of declarative debugging.
<p>

Declarative debugging systems compare the results of sub-computations
with what the programmer intended.  By asking the programmer questions
or using a formal specification the system can identify precisely where
in a program a bug is located.  Our research into declarative debugging
has made improvements over the original algorithms for debugging Prolog
and extended the ideas to other language paradigms such as functional and
object oriented languages.

received a large ARC grant to continue this research until the end of 1998.
Bert Thompson was employed
under this grant.
Zoltan and Lee received another large ARC grant to develop and
apply the technology to
<a href="http://www.cs.mu.oz.au/research/mercury/"> Mercury</a>.
Mark Brown did
related work on debugging Mercury
and <a href="http://www.cs.mu.oz.au/~bjpop">Bernie Pope</a>
has been working on debugging Haskell, with some help from summer
students Weyn Ong,
Toby Ord and Bryn Humberstone.
