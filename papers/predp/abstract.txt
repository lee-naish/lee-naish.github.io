This paper investigates the relationship between the use of
predicate-based and statement-based program spectra for bug localization.
Branch and path spectra are also considered.  Although statement and
predicate spectra can be based on the same raw data, the way the data
is aggregated results in different information being lost.  We propose
a simple and cheap modification to the statement-based approach which
retains strictly more information.  This allows us to compare statement
and predicate ``metrics'' (functions used to rank the statements,
predicates or paths).  We show that improved bug localization performance
is possible using single-bug models and benchmarks.
