<br>

We present a very simple but flexible declarative debugging scheme.
A declarative debugger can be defined in Prolog with a single clause and
relies on the definition of just two additional predicates.
With suitable definitions of these predicates the debugger can diagnose
several classes of bugs in many languages.
We give examples of
diagnosis of wrong answers in
functional, relational and object oriented languages
as well as missing answers in relational languages
and
calls which are not well-defined in functional languages.
By using declarative semantics of programs, the debugger is able to
hide complex execution mechanisms such as
unification,
backtracking,
coroutining,
parallelism,
higher order functions,
lazy evaluation,
message passing
and
inheritance.

Keywords: declarative algorithmic debugging, Prolog,
lazy higher order function, object oriented.
