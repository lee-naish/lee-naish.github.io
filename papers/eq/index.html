This paper describes  an  extension  to  NU-Prolog  which  allows
evaluable  functions  to be defined using equations.  We consider
it to be the most  pragmatic  way  of  combining  functional  and
relational  programming.   The implementation consists of several
hundred  lines  of  Prolog  code  and   the   underlying   Prolog
implementation  was  not modified at all.  However, the system is
reasonably efficient  and  supports  coroutining,  optional  lazy
evaluation,   higher  order  functions  and  parallel  execution.
Efficiency is gained in several ways.  First,  we  use  some  new
implementation techniques.  Second, we exploit some of the unique
features of NU-Prolog, though these features are not essential to
the  implementation.   Third, the language is designed so that we
can take advantage of implicit mode and determinism  information.
Although  we  have  not  concentrated  on  the  semantics  of the
language, we believe  that  our  language  design  decisions  and
implementation  techniques  will be useful in the next generation
of combined functional and relational languages.
