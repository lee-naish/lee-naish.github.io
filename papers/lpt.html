<TITLE>Logic Programming Techniques and Language Extensions</TITLE>
<H1>Logic Programming Techniques</H1>

Though the logic programming paradigm has been in use for over twenty
years, the programming methodology continues to be enriched.  Work on 
<em>skeletons and techniques</em> aims at systematic development of
logic programs for both novices and experts.  Related to this are
<em>higher order</em> styles of programming.  Various other techniques
more familiar in <em>lazy functional</em>, <em>object oriented</em>,
<em>imperative</em> or <em>relational database</em> languages have been
adapted to logic programming, sometimes using extensions to Prolog.
Other extensions to Prolog which are motivated by programming
methodology are <em>coroutining</em>, <em>sound negation</em>,
<em>types</em>, <em>modes</em> and new
<em>pruning operators</em>.  The study of <em>semantics</em> also
provides new ways of reasoning about the correctness of programs.
