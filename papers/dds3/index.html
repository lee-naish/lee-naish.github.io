<H1>A three-valued declarative debugging scheme</H1>

Declarative debugging has many advantages over conventional approaches
to debugging for logic and functional programs.  This paper extends a
<A HREF="../dds/">previously defined scheme</A>
for declarative debugging in which
computations were considered either correct or erroneous.  We argue
that a third value, "inadmissible", should be supported and show how
this can be done.  Two classes of bugs are defined: one equivalent to the
bugs defined by the two valued scheme, the other associated with
inadmissibility.  It is shown how different instances of the scheme can
be used to diagnose type errors, mode errors, violated assertions and
abnormal termination as well as the more familiar classes of bugs
detected by declarative debuggers.  Consequences for the semantics of
logic programs and how type schemes can be reconstructed using three
valued logic are briefly addressed.
