<h1>Mutable Algebraic Data Types, the Right Way</h1>

<p>
This is a rant, born out of years of frustration that so many programming
languages either do not support user-defined algebraic data types (ADTs)
at all, or support them poorly, in a way that forces the implementation to
be inefficient. It assumes some familiarity with ADTs and C. I know that
efficiency, and indeed data structures, do not have the importance they
had for programmers in the 1970's, when I began my career as a computer
scientist, but I hope I'm not alone in caring about them when it comes
to programming language design.  The ways ADT values are constructed
and examined can and should eliminate many potential programmer errors
- this is one of their strengths. For example, ADTs can prevent access
to the data in the root of a binary search tree without first ensuring
the tree is not empty, eliminating the possibility of dereferencing a
NULL pointer. Probably even more important is their expressive power.
For example, an ADT can represent either a "normal" value or an error
description, forcing code to check for errors before accessing the value
returned from a function (trust me, errors are not actually abnormal;
at my age they are not even uncommon).  I remember being amazed and
excited studying mathematics when I first saw the formula for finding
roots of a quadratic equation. Later I wrote corresponding code (in
FORTRAN) which, quite predictably, was ugly and buggy. To write elegant,
correct code to solve this problem it is important to first note there
are four possibilities (two roots, one root, no roots or everything is a
root), then decide how these possibilities are to be represented. ADTs
provide a natural solution. With less expressive data types there are
more opportunities for bugs.  ADTs are also often used with implicit
dynamic memory allocation and garbage collection, eliminating further
classes of errors.
</p>

<p>
Some more modern languages avoid NULL pointer dereferencing by having
"optional" values, which are a special case of ADTs, but there is
no general ADT support. Others support user-defined ADTs but they are
verbose, inelegant, expose too much of the (sometimes awfully inefficient)
implementation and allow classes of errors that good ADT support can
avoid.  Reading about such languages causes me to grit my teeth and
emit involuntary "old man" noises. I know it takes substantial work to
design and implement a programming language (I've done it a few times)
and to make it usable and stable enough to support a significant user
base is a huge effort. Far too much effort has gone into developing
programming languages while missing opportunities for good ADT support.
</p>

<p>
Functional programming languages have supported concise and elegant
definition of ADTs and used efficient representations of values for close
to fifty years, though with mutability (destructive update) severely
restricted.  My contention is that the "right" way to support mutable
algebraic data types is to allow mutability of just the arguments
of data constructors. For example we may have a trie-like type (a
binary tree with data only in the leaves) with two data constructors:
trie_node(left, right) for internal nodes and trie_leaf(data) for leaf
nodes. A programming language should support changing the data in a leaf
node and changing the left and right subtrees in an internal node but
it should not support the in-situ changing of a leaf node to an internal
node or vice versa.
</p>

<h2>Algebraic Data Type basics</h2>

<p>
An ADT is defined by a set of data constructors, each with a fixed number
of arguments of fixed types. Each value of the type is one of these
data constructors with arguments of the defined types.  Testing which
principal data constructor a value has and extracting the argument
values is typically combined, using some form of pattern matching.
For example, if binary search trees are defined as either tree_empty
or tree_node(left, data, right), the data in the root can only be
accessed via successful matching with a tree_node pattern.  ADT values
are typically constructed by applying a data constructor to arguments.
For example tree_node(l,x,r) will construct a tree with data x at the root
and subtrees l and r. Allocating memory, initializing it appropriately
and using pointers in the representation are all implicit.
</p>

<p>
There can be sharing of representations of different ADT values (for
example, the tree above will share the representation of the sub-trees
l and r rather than copy them) so updating one ADT variable may also
update other variables. This poses a challenge for languages that strive
for a simple semantics (as most functional programming languages do).
Destructive update can also be problematic if the type system is
polymorphic, allowing "types" such as list of t, where t is a type
variable that can be instantiated to any type, and polymorphic/generic code
that can be used for lists with any type for the elements. Polymorphism
is a very common and useful feature of languages with ADT support
but we do not discuss it in detail here. Despite these challenges,
destructive update of shared data structures is very useful and many
important algorithms rely on it. Mutable ADTs require a well-defined
memory model so it is clear what sharing exists, what variables will
be changed if a data structure is updated and when the memory may be
reclaimed.
</p>

<h2>Efficient Implementation</h2>

<p>
Functional programming languages typically represent ADT values using
"tagged pointers" to a block of memory containing the data constructor
arguments (there are many variations to the details).  Bits in the pointer
that are normally unused can encode data constructors that have arguments
(for example, least significant bits can be used for a tag if there is
byte addressing but word alignment of data).  If there are not enough
unused bits to encode all such data constructors, some are represented
with an extra "secondary tag" that can be stored with the arguments. Data
constructors with no arguments are represented by other values that
cannot be valid pointers. For example, an empty binary search tree can be
represented as zero (NULL) and a non-empty tree represented as (non-NULL)
pointer to a block of three words - exactly the same representation
that would normally be used in C with pointers to structs. For tries,
a leaf node can be represented as a pointer to a single word of data
and an internal node represented as a pointer to a block containing the
left and right subtrees, where the least significant bit of the pointer
is one - this is more efficient than can be done in portable C code.
</p>

<h2>Inefficient Orthodox Implementation</h2>

<p>
There is a portable general scheme for implementing ADTs in languages
such as C.  The arguments of a data constructor can be implemented by a
struct. Arguments of one of several different structs can be implemented
as a union of structs. A small integer tag can be used to represent
the data constructor itself, thus an ADT value can be represented as a
pointer to a dynamically allocated struct containing a tag and a union
of structs. Though this scheme works, it is cumbersome, uses unsafe
features (unions and pointers) and allows many programmer errors that
are impossible in languages with good ADT support.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, with this scheme the space used by every data constructor is
the size of the tag plus the maximum size needed for the arguments of any
data constructor (we will ignore any additional overheads associated with
dynamic memory allocation).  An empty tree will typically be represented
as a pointer to a dynamically allocated block of four words (enough
space to fit a tag and the arguments of a tree_node).  A tree with
N nodes (and N+1 empty trees) requires 8N+4 words for storage whereas
the efficient representation requires only 3N words.  If the programming
language allows an occurrence of one data constructor to be destructively
updated to another this inefficient representation can't be avoided.
</p>

<p>
Sadly, this inefficient representation is often chosen and the way ADTs
are supported in the language exposes the representation so it cannot be
changed to an efficient representation.  For example, if the language
exposes the fact that ADTs are represented as pointers, it immediately
begs the question "pointers to what?" and naturally leads to mutability of
what is pointed to. If the language makes ADTs more opaque (for example,
having application of data constructors to construct values and pattern
matching to deconstruct values as essentially the only operations)
there is greater flexibility in how ADTs are implemented, and generally
less opportunity for programmers to make errors.
</p>

<h2>Mutability in functional programming languages</h2>

<p>
Functional programming languages generally encourage writing
"pure" functions that behave as functions in the mathematical sense -
they just take some inputs and return a result; nothing else. In pure
code there are fewer dependencies between different parts of the code
and reasoning about correctness is much simpler. Mutability conflicts
with purity: a function is not pure if it destructively updates an
argument that is passed in (which may also share representation with
variables that appear elsewhere).  As mentioned earlier, it also causes
potential problems with polymorphic types. Allowing mutability without
destroying all guarantees of purity is very challenging. Typically,
functional programming languages do not allow ADTs values to be updated
except for a special type with a data constructor called ref (short for
reference) whose single argument can be updated. The type has no other
data constructors so a ref can be implemented as a pointer with no tag
(note that a ref cannot be NULL so it is always safe to dereference it).
Most code can operate on types that containing no refs and is therefore
guaranteed to be pure. Code that uses refs (that may be updated in any
function they are passed to) is potentially impure and is more difficult
to reason about (in Haskell, refs are restricted to certain "monads",
making the code pure in a technical sense, though no easier to reason
about).
</p>

<p>
Only allowing update of refs means that an extra layer of indirection
is needed for mutable data structures. If we want a list of integers
where the elements can be updated, we need to use a list of pointers to
(that is, refs of) integers instead, decreasing efficiency and using a
different type that is incompatible with (immutable) lists of integers.
Similarly, if we want to be able to update the tail of the list another
list type is required that uses pointers to pointers to list cells. If
we want mutability of both elements and the list tail a fourth type
is required.  Thus although functional programming languages provide
efficient implementations of ADTs, their implementation of mutable ADTs
is typically cumbersome and inefficient. Flexibility and efficiency are
sacrificed so some guarantees of purity can be made.
</p>

<h2>Achieving efficiency, safety and flexibility</h2>

<p>
It is possible to achieve both the efficient representation used by
functional programming languages and flexible mutability by allowing
update of all data constructor arguments. Data structures that can be
implemented using pointers to structs, such as linked lists and binary
search trees, can be implemented with no loss of efficiency or flexibility
but with the advantages ADTs have over lower level coding with explicit
pointers. Data structures that benefit from tagged pointers, such as
tries, can be implemented more efficiently than with portable C and can
be updated without additional indirection. Programmers just need to know
that when a new data constructor with arguments is created, the result is
something like a pointer to a struct containing a field for each argument
(there may be a tag somewhere but the details are not exposed).  With the
possible exception of refs, all dereferencing is combined with a switch
on the data constructor.  Please, if you are involved in the development
of programming languages, consider supporting ADTs in this way. As
inspiration, and a challenge to do better than my attempts (which is
not hard), I'll describe two related projects I have been involved with.
</p>

<p>
The first is <a href="https://lee-naish.github.io/papers/adtpp/">
adtpp</a>, a tool that supports ADTs in C. It processes a file
containing ADT definitions and other declarations and produces a C
header file that contains C type definitions, macros, functions etc.
Constructing an ADT value is done by applying a data constructor to zero
or more arguments (implemented as a call to a function with a pragma
suggesting it is inlined) and deconstructing can be done using several
pattern matching constructs that test the data constructor and allow
the arguments to be assigned to fresh variables, similar to functional
programming languages. Mutability is achieved by pattern matching
constructs that give pointers to arguments rather than the arguments
themselves and the pointers can then be used for destructive update in the
normal way.  There is no processing of C code; adtpp just relies on the
C preprocessor and compiler (this greatly simplifies implementation
and maintenance).  Although some effort is made to pick up potential
errors at compile time, the error messages produced from the C compiler
are far from ideal. Significant compromises are required for the syntax
of pattern matching constructs, since we rely on C macros, and support
of polymorphism, since the only type checking is done by the C compiler.
Instead of the language implementation inferring instances of polymorphic
types for data constructors and functions, the programmer must declare
all such instances and use distinct names for them. Even as a "parent"
of adtpp, I have to admit it is ugly, but it does demonstrate you can
support efficient mutable ADTs in C with minimal effort (less than
4000 lines of code).  Properly incorporating the basic ideas into a
programming language that supports pointers and assignment would have
a relatively small cost and large benefit.
</p>

<p>
The second is <a href="https://lee-naish.github.io/src/pawns/index.html"> Pawns</a>,
a prototype functional programming language that compiles to C using
adtpp. By default, Pawns code is pure and destructive update is not
allowed. However, with suitable declarations and annotations, all data
constructor arguments are mutable, allowing flexibility similar to an
imperative programming language. One of the principles of Pawns is that
all side-effects should be obvious from the code. If a function call
may update a variable passed as an argument, it must be made obvious
by an annotation on the argument. If the variable may also share with
other variables, this must also be indicated by further annotations. The
compiler does extensive analysis of the sharing of data structures in
order to check that the code has sufficient annotations.  In addition,
functions can have pre-conditions and post-conditions concerning sharing
between arguments and the result returned; these are also checked by the
compiler. Data structures can be built efficiently, using destructive
update, then passed to pure code where reasoning about the code is
relatively easy.  Potentially we can have the advantages of pure code
while retaining flexibility and efficiency. The cost is the rather
complex sharing analysis required.
</p>

<h2>Tagged pointers as a language feature, anyone?</h2>

<p>
The basic features of portable C (and many other programming languages)
are not good for efficient implementation of ADTs and they are
unsafe. Writing to one field of an undiscriminated union then reading
from another has an undefined result. Similarly, dereferencing a NULL
pointer typically yields a runtime error (my first programming language
implementation was on a VAX computer which happily dereferenced NULL
pointers but, conveniently, address zero always seemed to contain
zero). Pointers that have a dereference operation but can also be NULL
are attributed to Tony Hoare, who later described it as "the billion
dollar mistake".  Such pointers can be made safe by either eliminating
the reserved NULL value, like references in functional languages, or only
allowing dereferencing when it is combined with a switch or conditional
construct, like an option ADT.  It would be relatively easy to support
"tagged pointer" types that are a discriminated union of several reference
or (non-NULL) pointer types plus several reserved values like NULL. A
tagged pointer could be created from one of the reference types or a
reserved value. A switch or conditional construct could allow access to
the reference (or what it points to).
</p>

<p> With tagged pointers, ADTs could be implemented by using pointers
to a distinct struct type for each data constructor with arguments and
a distinct reserved value for each other data constructor (this is how
adtpp is implemented). For example, a trie could be represented by a
discriminated union of a pointer to a struct containing the leaf data
and a pointer to a struct containing the two sub-trees of an internal
node. This scheme reduces the flexibility for how secondary tags are
managed (when there are too many data constructors with arguments for
the available spare bits in pointers) and I don't feel that exposing
how ADTs are implemented is generally desirable.  However, having tagged
pointers as an abstraction breaks to nexus between creation of a tagged
pointer and allocating and initializing memory that can represent the
arguments of a data constructor. This could allow more flexibility with
memory allocation (for example, allocating on the stack rather than the
heap), potentially increasing efficiency though raising issues of the
lifetime of the struct and possibility of dangling pointers. A tagged
pointer abstraction may also have uses unrelated to ADTs.
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p> Algebraic data types are great. They are expressive and can help
avoid many programmer errors. Unfortunately, very few programming
languages support them well.  They were first developed for functional
programming languages, which value guarantees of "purity" (lack of
side-effects etc.) and polymorphic type systems. Both of these desirable
features are difficult to combine with mutability of ADTs, though some
approaches have been developed. However, ADTs are also a very useful
feature for other programming language paradigms where purity and
(to a lesser extent) polymorphic type systems are not important.
If mutability is restricted to arguments of data constructors,
ADTs can be implemented very efficiently - identical to pointers to
structs for simple cases and more efficient than portable C code in
more complex cases. The efficient representations use tagged pointers,
which have been used extensively in the implementation of functional
(and other) programming languages but no portable abstraction of them
has been incorporated into mainstream programming languages. Pervasive
abstractions such as Hoare-style pointers, structs and unions can be
used to implement ADTs in a less efficient way and this seems to have
significantly influenced designers of programming languages that support
ADTs. If we value user-defined data structures in a programming language,
ADTs should be supported. If we also value efficiency, only arguments of
data constructors should be mutable and tagged pointers should be used
in the representation. My hope is that with the creativity of those who
design and implement programming languages, good support for ADTs will
some day become far more common than Hoare-style pointers are today. All
those hard working programmers deserve it.
