<H1>Pascal's Triangle and debugging software</H1>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p> I was attempting to evaluate different ranking methods for statistical
approached to debugging software by randomly sampling the (potentially)
very large search space.  The results were not quite what I expected and
I realised the method of sampling I had been using didn't give a uniform
distribution.  I wanted to consider the execution paths through a program
when the program is run multiple times (each case in a test suite).

<h2>Counting partitionings of sequences</h2>

<p> To generate a uniform distribution I wanted to know how many ways
a program with <em>p</em> distinct execution paths could behave over
a set of <em>t</em> test executions.  The different test executions
can be sorted/grouped according to what path was used, thus the number
of possible behaviours is the number of ways a sequence of length
<em>t</em> (&gt;=0) can be partitioned into <em>p</em> (&gt;=1) possibly
empty sub-sequences.  The first partition can be of any length from 0
to <em>t</em> with the remainder being partitioned into <em>p-1</em>
subsequences, so we can use the recurrence:

<p>
<table width=80%>
<tr>
<td width=60%>
<em>f(t,p)= sum for i=0 to t of f(i,p-1)
</td>
<td>
(1)
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
with
<em>f(0,p)=1</em> and <em>f(t,1)=1</em>.
</td>
<td>
</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p>
This can be used to construct the following table (the first row
corresponding to <em>t=0, etc</em>):<br>
<pre>
1  1  1  1  1
1  2  3  4  5
1  3  6 10 15 . . .
1  4 10 20 35
1  5 15 35 70
      .
      .
      .
</pre>

<p> Note it is symmetrical - <em>f(t,p) = f(p-1,t+1)</em> - so the
following <a name="rec2"> recurrence</a> could also be used with the
same base cases:

<p>
<table width=80%>
<tr>
<td width=60%>
<em>f(t,p)= sum for i=1 to p of f(t-1,i)
</td>
<td>
(2)
</td>
</tr>

</table>

<h2>Pascal's Triangle</h2>

<p> It is also yet another way of characterising <a
href="http://www.research.att.com/~njas/sequences/A007318"> Pascal's
triangle</a> (the <em>binomial</em> numbers), normally written:<br>
<pre>
       1
      1 1
     1 2 1
    1 3 3 1
   1 4 6 4 1
   ...
</pre>
and constructed using the recurrence:
<p>
<table width=80%>
<tr>
<td width=60%>
<em>C(n,k)= C(n-1,k-1) + C(n-1,k), for n &gt; 1, 0 &lt;= k &lt;= n</em>
</td>
<td>
(3)
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
with
<em>C(n,0)=1</em> and <em>C(n,n)=1</em>.
</td>
<td>
</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p>
A closed form solution is <em>C(n,k)=n!/(k!*(n-k)!)</em>.

<p>We have, <em>f(t,p) = f(p-1,t+1) = C(t+p-1,t) = C(t-1+p,p-1)</em>.
For example, <em>f(3,3) = f(2,4) = C(5,3) = C(5,2) = 10</em>.

<h2>Generating partitionings</h2>

<p> A randomly generated number <em>n</em> in the range 1 to
<em>f(t,p)</em> can be mapped to a multiset of execution paths using
Pascal's triangle and different ranking methods can be evaluated.
The mapping can also be of interest.

<p> We can write the multiset as a (base <em>&gt;t</em>) number
with <em>p</em> digits where the sum of the digits is <em>t</em>.
The <em>k<sup>th</sup></em> digit gives the number of times the
<em>k<sup>th</sup></em> execution path is used (or the length of the
<em>k<sup>th</sup></em> subsequence).  There are <em>f(t,p)</em>
such numbers.  We can have a mapping <em>g(t,n,p)</em> which enumerates
these in increasing order.  For example:
<table>
<tr>
<th>n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</th>
<th><em>g(2,n,4)&nbsp;&nbsp;</th>
<th><em>g(3,n,3)&nbsp;&nbsp;</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> 1 </td>
<td> 0002 </td>
<td> 003 </td>
<tr>
<td> 2 </td>
<td> 0011 </td>
<td> 012 </td>
<tr>
<td> 3 </td>
<td> 0020 </td>
<td> 021 </td>
<tr>
<td> 4 </td>
<td> 0101 </td>
<td> 030 </td>
<tr>
<td> 5 </td>
<td> 0110 </td>
<td> 102 </td>
<tr>
<td> 6 </td>
<td> 0200 </td>
<td> 111 </td>
<tr>
<td> 7 </td>
<td> 1001 </td>
<td> 120 </td>
<tr>
<td> 8 </td>
<td> 1010 </td>
<td> 201 </td>
<tr>
<td> 9 </td>
<td> 1100 </td>
<td> 210 </td>
<tr>
<td> 10 </td>
<td> 2000 </td>
<td> 300 </td>
</tr>
</table>

Note the second and third columns gives the start of OEIS sequences <a
href="http://www.research.att.com/~njas/sequences/A052216"> A052216</a>
and <a href="http://www.research.att.com/~njas/sequences/A052217">
A052217</a>, respectively.  In general, <em>g(2,n,p)</em> is the
<em>n<sup>th</sup></em> element of A052216 assuming <em>p</em> is such
that <em>n &lt;= f(2,p)</em>.  Similarly for <em>g(3,n,p)</em> and
<a href="http://www.research.att.com/~njas/sequences/A052217">
A052217</a>, <em>g(4,n,p)</em> and <a
href="http://www.research.att.com/~njas/sequences/A052218">
A052218</a>, etc.

<p> Recurrence <a href="#rec2">(2)</a> is helpful in constructing this
mapping.  Consider g(2,n,4).  This can be generated by the numbers in
the table with smaller <em>t</em> values and smaller or equal <em>p</em>
values (we can also ignore the row of ones):
<pre>
(1  1  1)
 1  2  3
 1  3  6
</pre>

The most significant digit is at least 1 if <em>n&gt;6</em> and is
at least 2 if <em>n&gt;6+3</em>.  If <em>n&lt;=6</em> the previous
column gives the next digit in the same way: 2 if <em>n&gt;3+2</em>,
1 if <em>3+2&gt;=n&gt;3</em> and 0 if <em>3&lt;=n</em>.  Similarly, if
<em>3&gt;=n&gt;1+1</em> the third digit is 2, if <em>1+1&gt;=n&gt;1</em>
its 1 and if <em>1&gt;=n</em> its 0.  To summarise, the rightmost column
allows us to compute the most significant digit; other digits can be
computed with the previous columns.

<p> If some digits get "used up" (are non-zero), we subtract the
appropriate number from <em>n</em> and (recursively) compute the
remaining number of digits with the smaller <em>n</em>.  For example, to
compute <em>g(3,7,3)</em> we use the following part of the array:
<pre>
1  2
1  3
1  4
</pre>

The most significant digit is 1 since <em>4+3&gt;=n&gt;4</em>.  We then
have to compute two more digits which sum to 2, with <em>n=7-4=3</em>
(that is <em>g(2,3)</em>,2).  Since <em>n&gt;1+1</em> the next digit is
2 and the last is zero.  The case where the leading digit is zero need
not be a special case: <em>g(4,23,6) = 000000 + g(4,23-0,5) =  000000 +
g(4,23-0,4) = 001000 + g(3,23-15,3) = 001200 + g(1,8-4-3,2) = 001200 +
g(1,1,1) = </em>
<a href="http://www.research.att.com/~njas/sequences/A052218">
001201</a>.  To summarise, the first non-zero digit is computed using
all the rows; whenever a digit <em>d</em> is generated, the last
<em>d</em> rows can be eliminated and only the remaining rows used. 
Here are two traces for the case above produced by implementations of
the function.  The first is more imperative in style, the second is
more declarative.
<table>
<tr>
<th>Imperative</th>
<th>Declarative</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
Computing g(sum = 4, n = 23)
15=f(4,3)&lt;n=23&lt;=f(4,4)=35
Increment digit 3; remaining sum = 3; remaining n = 8
4=f(3,2)&lt;n=8&lt;=f(3,3)=10
Increment digit 2; remaining sum = 2; remaining n = 4
3=f(2,2)&lt;n=4&lt;=f(2,3)=6
Increment digit 2; remaining sum = 1; remaining n = 1
n=1 so digit 0 = remaining sum = 1
Result is 1201
</pre>
<td>
<pre>
Computing g(4, 23, 6);  g(4, 23, 6) =
000000 + g(4, 23, 5);  g(4, 23, 5) =
 00000 + g(4, 23, 4);  g(4, 23, 4) =
  1000 + g(3, 8, 4);  g(3, 8, 4) =
  0000 + g(3, 8, 3);  g(3, 8, 3) =
   100 + g(2, 4, 3);  g(2, 4, 3) =
   100 + g(1, 1, 3);  g(1, 1, 3) =
   001 so g(4, 23, 6) =
  1201
</pre>

<p> The program can very quickly compute that the 4 billionth number whose
decimal digits sum to 9 is 100010000000000012000001000001001000000000010,
for example.  I will refrain from giving a more detailed
description of the algorithm and posting the code until after a <a
href="http://www.csse.unimelb.edu.au/253"> 433-253</a> programming
project has been completed.

<h2>Results</h2>

The algorithm has been implemented in C and the effectiveness of
various proposed ranking methods have been assessed.  The effectiveness
correlates well with empirical results applying these methods to the
Siemens test suite.  A new ranking method has also been developed - it
is optimal using a simple program containing a single bug, assuming a
uniform distribution for the tests cases.  In practice it significantly
out-performs other methods on the Siemens test suite!  A paper on this
topic is in preparation.
