<h1>A Brief Overview of the Pawns Programming Language</h1>

<h3>

<p> This paper describes the Pawns programming language, currently under
development, which uses several novel features to combine the functional
and imperative programming paradigms. It supports pure functional
programming (including algebraic data types, higher-order programming and
parametric polymorphism), where the representation of values need not be
considered. It also supports lower-level C-like imperative programming
with pointers and the destructive update of all fields of the structs
used to represent the algebraic data types. All destructive update of
variables is made obvious in Pawns code, via annotations on statements and
in type signatures. Type signatures must also declare sharing between any
arguments and result that may be updated. For example, if two arguments
of a function are trees that share a subtree and the subtree is updated
within the function, both variables must be annotated at that point in
the code, and the sharing and update of both arguments must be declared
in the type signature of the function. The compiler performs extensive
sharing analysis to check that the declarations and annotations are
correct. This analysis allows destructive update to be encapsulated: a
function with no update annotations in its type signature is guaranteed to
behave as a pure function, even though the value returned may have been
constructed using destructive update within the function. Additionally,
the sharing analysis helps support a constrained form of global variables
that also allows destructive update to be encapsulated and safe update
of variables with polymorphic types to be performed.  <p>

Keywords: functional programming language, destructive update,
