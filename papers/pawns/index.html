<h1>An informal introduction to Pawns: a declarative/imperative language</h1>

<h3>
			Lee Naish
</h3>

<p>
Pawns is yet another programming language under development which attempts
to combine the elegance of declarative programming with the algorithmic
expressive power of imperative programming.  Algebraic data types can
be defined and viewed as decriptions of high level values which can be
manipulated in declarative ways.  The same type definitions can also
be viewed at a much lower level, involving pointers to possibly shared
data structures which can be destructively updated.  Pawns programs
contain annotations and declarations which indicate whether the high
or low level view should be used in different program components and
what variables may be updated at each point.  This makes all effects
obvious and allows efficient imperative code to be encapsulated within
a declarative interface, with "purity" of functions and consistency of
annotations and declarations being guaranteed by the compiler.
