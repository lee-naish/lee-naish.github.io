Note:  The first version of this paper was submitted for publication in
the last millennium.  Successive versions have spent many years with
reviewers, plus I have taken substantial time revising technical and
sylistic aspects, out-staying the terms of several editors and even
a journal.  For years the paper seemed well and truly floundered. But
finally it has been transformed into success, accepted to appear in
Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP).

<h1>Transforming floundering into success</h1>

We show how logic programs with "delays" can be transformed
to programs without delays in a way which preserves information
concerning floundering (also known as deadlock).  This allows
a declarative (model-theoretic), bottom-up or goal independent
approach to be used for analysis and debugging of properties
related to floundering.  We rely on some previously introduced
restrictions on delay primitives and a key observation which allows
properties such as groundness to be analysed by approximating the
(ground) success set.
