<h1>Probabilistic Declarative Debugging</h1>

<p>
We present a probabilistic approach to the search strategy for
declarative debugging. We focus on diagnosing wrong answers in pure
Prolog programs but the approach can be adapted to other languages (for
example, functional languages) and bug symptoms. Drawing information
from source code and the execution of passed and failed test cases,
different search heuristics are combined using probability theory. This
reduces the expected number and complexity of questions. We appeal to
rationality to compare several search algorithms. Algorithms such as
ours, which use more information and make weaker assumptions, generally
have better performance. Examples are also given to illustrate how the
algorithm can perform extremely well when certain heuristics are
effective, and reasonably well even when the heuristics are
ineffective.
