<h1>Sharing analysis in the Pawns compiler

Pawns is a programming language under development that supports
algebraic data types, polymorphism, higher order functions and "pure"
declarative programming. It also supports impure imperative features
including destructive update of shared data structures via pointers,
allowing significantly increased efficiency for some operations. A
novelty of Pawns is that all impure "effects" must be made obvious in
the source code and they can be safely encapsulated in pure functions
in a way that is checked by the compiler. Execution of a pure function
can perform destructive updates on data structures that are local to
or eventually returned from the function without risking modification
of the data structures passed to the function. This paper describes
the sharing analysis which allows impurity to be encapsulated. Aspects
of the analysis are similar to other published work, but in addition
it handles explicit pointers and destructive update, higher order
functions including closures and pre- and post-conditions concerning
sharing for functions.
