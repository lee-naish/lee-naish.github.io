<H2><A NAME="SECTION00036000000000000000">
Programs naturally have more than one meaning</A>
</H2>

<P>
Much of the work on semantics of logic programs, particularly with
negation, attempts to define <I>the</I> (unique) meaning of a logic
program.  Authors argue that the meaning they define is more natural than
any other.  For definite programs, the consensus amongst these authors
is that the minimum model is <I>the</I> meaning (the set of true atoms).
We have argued that this is typically not the case.  Furthermore, there is
no unique meaning, even for definite programs.  Here we consider possible
meanings of the <TT>merge/3</TT> program (Figure <A HREF="node5.html#fig_merge">1</A>) again
(in Section <A HREF="node20.html#sec_verif">6</A> we give further examples).  An alternative
description is as follows (a ``run'' being a maximal sorted sublist):
<PRE>
merge(As, Bs, Cs): Cs is an interleaving of the lists
of integers As and Bs and the number of runs in Cs is
the maximum number of runs in As and Bs
</PRE>

<P>
This could be refined to define the interleaving more precisely.
Implementing this second specification (or verifying an implementation)
requires different reasoning from the first and the implementation is
likely to be used in different ways (a different version of merge sort,
for example).  The two specifications correspond to distinct three-valued
models of <TT>merge/3</TT> which are natural and useful.  In the first
an atom is inadmissible if <TT>As</TT> or <TT>Bs</TT> are not sorted
lists of numbers.  In the second an atom is inadmissible if <TT>As</TT>
or <TT>Bs</TT> are not lists of integers (for example, with heterogeneous
lists of integers and floats an implementation which uses the standard
ordering over terms may produce wrong answers).  Thus the different
interpretations are incomparable.  Each interpretation is a model of
many reasonable <TT>merge/3</TT> programs and some <TT>merge/3</TT>
programs have both these interpretations (and others) as models.

<P>
Ignoring the type of the list elements and comparison operator, our second
intended interpretation has more information about how the predicate
should behave.  Implementers of Prolog built-in and library predicates
surely know and care about how their predicates behave at least as much
as typical Prolog programmers, but documentation for the various versions
of <TT>merge/3</TT> almost always restrict attention to sorted lists
and I have never seen a more informative high level description used.
The description of <TT>merge/3</TT> (and many other predicates) can also
be made more precise by considering other possible modes.  If we say
that <TT>merge/3</TT> atoms in which the third argument is a sorted
list are also admissible we have another model, capturing the fact
that <TT>merge/3</TT> can work ``backwards'' to nondeterministically
split a sorted list into two, assuming a suitable computation rule,
or to check if a sorted list can be split into two given terms.
We often restrict our attention to certain modes and this leads to
less precise understanding of program behaviour from a declarative as
well as procedural view.  Similarly, most people are taught how to use
accumulators in Prolog without gaining a precise high level understanding
of the code.  Many programmers intend their <TT>rev_acc(As, [],
Bs)</TT> call to succeed if and only if <TT>Bs</TT> is the reverse of list
<TT>As</TT> but only later, if ever, develop a more informed view of
the behaviour when the second argument is a non-empty list (this can
certainly be useful) or perhaps even an arbitrary term.
