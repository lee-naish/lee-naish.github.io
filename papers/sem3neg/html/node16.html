Operational semantics</A>
</H2>

<P>
The operational semantics we use is essentially SLDNF resolution,
where negative literals must be ground in order to be selected.
We define trees to formalise the operational semantics.  There are a
few differences between our definitions and the standard SLDNF tree
definitions.  First, for technical convenience evaluation of negative
literals is done within the same tree structure (like [<A
 HREF="node22.html#martelli">Martelli and TricomiMartelli and
  Tricomi1992</A>],
rather than having separate trees of different ranks) and equality
atoms/constraints are used rather than substitutions.  Second, treatment
of floundering within negation is improved (it is often done poorly).
Third, we distinguish between searching for all solutions and just some
solution(s).  Our main aim is to establish results about observables from
Prolog computations, namely, zero or more (possibly floundered) computed
answers and possibly an indication there are no (more) answers (we ignore
computations which are aborted -- we have no results for such cases).
These are always the result of a finite search and we define finite
trees which correspond to such computations.  Even if all SLDNF trees
are infinite the search may be finite because only some solution(s)
may be needed (at the top level or inside a negation).

<P>
<P>
<DIV><B>Definition  9</B> (SLDDNF tree)  &nbsp; 
An SLDDNF tree is a (possibly infinite) tree where nodes are connected
by positive or negative edges.  The positive nodes of a (sub)tree are
those connected to the root with a sequence of positive edges.

<P>
Each node contains a conjunction of literals including equality atoms.
Nodes containing an unsatisfiable set of equality atoms are said to be
<I>failed</I> and have no children.  Nodes containing a satisfiable set
of equality atoms and no other literals are said to be <I>successful</I>
and have no children.  A literal is said to be <I>grounded</I> if the
substitution obtained by unifying the arguments of each equality atom
would make the literal ground.  Nodes containing only a satisfiable
set of equality atoms and non-grounded negative literals are said
to be <I>floundered</I> and have no children.  Other nodes have a
<I>selected literal</I>, which is not an equality atom and must be
grounded if it is negative.

A Prolog implementation can be seen as searching an SLDDNF tree (typically
depth-first and left to right) for one or more successful positive nodes.
When such nodes are found at the top level the equations in the node
(equivalent to variable bindings) may be displayed in a suitable
fashion and the search may stop.  When such nodes are found within a
negation the search typically stops and backtracking is initiated at
the higher level (where the negation was called).  Observation trees
can model such behaviour.   All-observations trees model computations
which find all solutions and terminate.  Finitely failed observations
trees are all-observations trees (note that corresponding SLDDNF trees
may have infinite branches inside negations).  We do not explicitly
model computations which flounder without succeeding or searching the
entire tree.  They are of limited interest, especially inside negation,
though it would be easy to modify our definitions to support them.
Similarly, we do not model non-depth-first computations where some
branches are only partially searched.

<P>
Many implementations neglect to check that negative literals are ground
(leading to unsoundness), and even those which do typically have unsound
treatment of floundering within negation (this is sometimes treated
poorly in the theoretical literature also).  Our (novel) solution here
is that selecting a negative literal which flounders does nothing to
the current goal.  If a different literal is selected subsequently,
which would occur with a fair computation rule, failure may result; if
the same literal is always selected the tree will be infinite.  If <IMG
 WIDTH="19" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img89.png"
 ALT="$N$">
was considered a positive leaf in this case instead, and an exception
mechanism was invoked or some kind of abnormal termination was flagged
it could be more practical, but harder to formalise.

<P>
An advantage of our approach (at least in theory) is that it potentially
avoids a source of incompleteness.  Suppose we have a goal with two ground
negated atoms, one of which flounders and the other succeeds.  There is
no <I>a priori</I> way of determining which literal should be selected.
For example, in Figure , the goal <IMG
 WIDTH="34" HEIGHT="28" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img102.png"
 ALT="$\leftarrow p$"> has a
successful SLDNF derivation but when the resolvent <!-- MATH

 -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="69" HEIGHT="28" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img103.png"
 ALT="$\leftarrow \neg
r, \neg s$"> is encountered the right literal must be selected to avoid
floundering using the normal semantics.  With our semantics we may first
select <IMG
 WIDTH="23" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img104.png"
 ALT="$\neg r$"> but that just leaves the current goal unchanged, allowing
us to then select <IMG
 WIDTH="23" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img105.png"
 ALT="$\neg s$"> (a fair computation rule would select <IMG
 WIDTH="23" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img105.png"
 ALT="$\neg s$"> eventually; an unfair rule may result in a loop).
