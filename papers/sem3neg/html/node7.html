Three-valued declarative debugging</A>
</H2>

<P>
A general scheme for declarative debugging using three truth values
is described in [<A
 HREF="node22.html#ddscheme3">NaishNaish2000a</A>]; it is based on a more traditional
two-valued scheme [<A
 HREF="node22.html#ddscheme">NaishNaish1997</A>].  Computations are represented as trees
and debuggers search the tree for a <I>buggy</I> node.  For diagnosing
wrong answers in definite clause programs, the tree is a proof tree
(see [<A
 HREF="node22.html#Llo84">LloydLloyd1984</A>]): each node contains an atom <IMG
 WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img14.png"
 ALT="$A$"> which was proved
in the computation and the children of the node contain the atoms in
the body of the clause instance which was used at the top level of
the proof of <IMG
 WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img14.png"
 ALT="$A$">.  Each node has a truth value associated with it:
<I>correct</I>, if the atom is true in the intended interpretation,
<I>erroneous</I>, if the atom is false, or <I>inadmissible</I>, the
third truth value<A NAME="tex2html3"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot89"><SUP><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]"
 SRC="file:/usr/lib/latex2html/icons/footnote.png"></SUP></A>.  The truth value is determined by an ``oracle''.  The user is
asked questions and typically these are stored in a database to avoid
repeated questions.  The user may also be able to supply more general
assertions or even runnable specifications [<A
 HREF="node22.html#Drabent-88">Drabent and MaluszynskiDrabent and
  Maluszynski1988</A>].

<P>
If a node is erroneous but all its children are correct, it corresponds
to an <I>incorrect clause instance</I>: the body is true but the head
is false.  This class of bugs was identified in the first work on
declarative debugging [<A
 HREF="node22.html#Sha83">ShapiroShapiro1983</A>].  Another class of bugs, related to
inadmissibility, was identified in [<A
 HREF="node22.html#Per86">PereiraPereira1986</A>] and formalised more in
[<A
 HREF="node22.html#ddscheme3">NaishNaish2000a</A>]: nodes which are erroneous with no erroneous children but
at least one inadmissible child.  In a top-down execution this corresponds
to a clause instance which causes a transition from admissible atoms to
inadmissible atoms.  It allows an inadmissible atom to be used in the
(dubious) ``proof'' of a false atom.  For such a bug to be manifest,
the inadmissible call must succeed (if the inadmissible call fails the
top level false atom would also fail, so there would be no bug symptom
to diagnose).  However, the diagnosis algorithm does not consider how
or why the inadmissible call succeeds.  The fact it succeeds is not
considered an error -- the error is that it is called at all.

<P>
Several different instances of the three-valued declarative debugging
scheme were identified, using different definitions of inadmissibility.
Although our previous work on types and debugging provides the
intuition for this paper, we do not rely on any particular definition
of inadmissibility here.  We simply assume that the programmer has
some notion of (in)admissibility for ground atoms.  If inadmissibility
is identified with ill-typedness (as suggested in [<A
 HREF="node22.html#Per86">PereiraPereira1986</A>]) then
the second class of bugs correspond to a form of type error discussed
in [<A
 HREF="node22.html#naish:90">NaishNaish1992b</A>].  However, this definition of inadmissibility does
not lead to ideal behaviour of debuggers [<A
 HREF="node22.html#ddscheme3">NaishNaish2000a</A>] and does not
quite capture the intentions of programmers.

<P>
As well as considering types, programmers consider modes.  A successful
call to <code>merge/3</code> in which just the last argument is not a sorted
list is very different from a successful call where the second argument
is not a sorted list.  For <TT>merge([2,3], [1,2], [2,1,2,3])</TT> we
would consider that the output is wrong and there is a bug in <code>merge/3</code>
whereas for <TT>merge([2,3], [2,1], [2,1,2,3])</TT> we would consider that
the input is wrong and the bug is elsewhere.  A more natural definition
of inadmissibility for ground atoms is that the ``input'' arguments of
the atom are ill-typed (or violate some condition).  In [<A
 HREF="node22.html#ddscheme3">NaishNaish2000a</A>]
this definition of inadmissibility is related to a declarative view of
modes [<A
 HREF="node22.html#modes">NaishNaish1996</A>], which gives a more technical definition that captures
the intuitive idea of input arguments being ill-typed.
