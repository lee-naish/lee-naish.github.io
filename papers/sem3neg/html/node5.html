<P>
The major flaw in this otherwise beautiful picture is that, in practice,
the intended interpretation is generally <I>not</I> a model.
Consider the following informal predicate description.
<PRE>
merge(As, Bs, Cs): Cs is the sorted list of numbers
which is the multiset union of sorted lists As and Bs
</PRE>
This would make a reasonable comment attached to some code (for example,
Figure ) or a specification for a programmer (for example,
an exercise in an introductory Prolog course).  In addition, it might
be helpful to say that <TT>As</TT> and <TT>Bs</TT> are intended to be
input, though there is no notion of input and output in the conventional
declarative semantics.  Programmers have little difficulty with such
descriptions of the intended behaviour of predicates.  It could be
surmised that such descriptions correspond to intended interpretations of
the model theory and that the primary job of a programmer is to construct
programs for which such interpretations are models.  However, critical
examination reveals this to be false, even for very simple programs.

<P>
First, the intended interpretation being a model only guarantees soundness
(partial correctness or no wrong answers).  In reality, some form of
completeness is also necessary: if every predicate always fails then
the intended interpretation will be a model but the program will not be
very useful!  Without considering negation, the most obvious way to avoid
missing answers is for the intended interpretation to be the minimum model
(which is the same as the success set).  We discuss another possibility
in section <A HREF="node8.html#sec_bg_neg">3.5</A>.

<P>
Second, consider the first clause for <TT>merge/3</TT> (the same as
the base case for the well known <TT>append/3</TT> program).  It can
succeed with non-lists, and precisely which calls to <TT>merge/3</TT>
containing non-lists succeed is a subtle property of the code and not
dealt with at all in the predicate description (from the description
we might assume that no such calls should succeed).  The description is
symmetric with respect to the first two arguments but the code is not,
and the set of successful calls with non-lists is not.  If the code was
changed so the first two arguments of each <TT>merge/3</TT> atom were
swapped, we would have a different definition with a different success
set and minimum model.  Similarly, we could swap these two arguments
in just recursive calls -- either or both of them.  Which (if any)
of these is correct according to the (single) intended interpretation?

<P>
