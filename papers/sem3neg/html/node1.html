Introduction</A>
</H1>

<P>
When programming, we often give too little attention to the meaning
of our code.  For these sins of sloth and pride (``I can't be bothered
re-checking everything -- I'm sure I got it right'') we are forced to
do penance, in the form of debugging.  During the repetitive tedium
we contemplate the relationships between our code, its behaviour and
our desires: the domain of programming language semantics.  Thus (in
retrospect) it is natural for work on debugging to lead to work
on semantics.  All too often, work on semantics seems to bear little
relation to any stage of the software life cycle.  Here our aim is to
provide theoretical support which can allow programmers to reason about
the correctness of their code more easily.

<P>
The starting point for our three-valued approach to semantics was
declarative debugging of logic programs.  The conventional view of
the semantics of logic programs [<A
 HREF="node22.html#Llo84">LloydLloyd1984</A>] and declarative debugging
[<A
 HREF="node22.html#Sha83">ShapiroShapiro1983</A>] [<A
 HREF="node22.html#Llo87">LloydLloyd1987</A>] is as follows.  Every ground atom is either true
or false in the intended interpretation of the program.  True atoms should
succeed and false atoms should fail.  To isolate a bug a declarative
debugger compares the intended interpretation with the behaviour of a
program in a particular instance which terminates and which produces
unexpected results.  It has been noted by various researchers that
this strict division into true and false does not correspond to the
intentions of typical programmers.  There are some atoms encountered
during debugging which simply should not occur in correct programs (for
example, ``ill-typed'' atoms).  Whether they succeed or fail is not the
issue.  A third truth value, <I>inadmissible</I>, has been introduced
into declarative debugging for such atoms [<A
 HREF="node22.html#Per86">PereiraPereira1986</A>] [<A
 HREF="node22.html#PerCal88">Pereira and CalejoPereira and
  Calejo1988</A>]
[<A
 HREF="node22.html#ddscheme3">NaishNaish2000a</A>].  This is a recognition that, in practice, <I>intended
interpretations are three-valued</I> rather than two-valued.  Similarly,
most work on formal specifications allows for the behaviour of a module
to be unspecified if <I>preconditions</I> are violated.  The aim of this
paper is to reconstruct the semantics of logic programs with this in mind.

<P>
There are many reasons for studying programming language semantics.
One is pure philosophy -- knowing more about a language for the
sake of knowing.  A formal semantics is also a useful guide for an
implementer and allows programmers to write portable code which has
predictable behaviour.  It can also be used for optimisation and
analysis of programs, to help make implementations more efficient as
well as correct.  Semantics can also provide useful ways for programmers
to think about their code, and can be the basis for program development
environments including debuggers.  This is the main focus for our work --
we provide a semantics for <I>logic programmers</I> (though implementers
and philosophers may also be interested).  We aim to allow programmers to
reason about the partial correctness of programs as easily as possible.
Model theory is particularly attractive due to its simplicity -- partial
correctness can be ensured if the intended interpretation is a model
of each clause in the program.  It is a useful guide for constructing
programs, an excellent tool for verification of programs and enables
declarative debugging.  Finally, all the considerations above can be
used in the design of programming languages.

<P>
There is (very) extensive work on negation in logic programming
(see [<A
 HREF="node22.html#apt94logic">Apt and BolApt and Bol1994</A>]) including some three-valued approaches
[<A
 HREF="node22.html#Fitting85">FittingFitting1985</A>][<A
 HREF="node22.html#Kun87">KunenKunen1987</A>].  The work tends to be directed at
solving mathematical and computational problems in order to make the
declarative and procedural semantics as close as possible, and there is
a general desire to be able to assign a meaning to all possible programs.
In our view, both these goals have questionable benefit for programmers.
The declarative semantics should support a notion of inadmissibility which
is not tied down to any particular program behaviour, thus leading to
an inevitable gap between declarative and procedural readings.  A key
question for programmers is whether a program is correct according
to their intended interpretation.  If the answer is no, one possible
solution is to change the intended interpretation -- ``its not a bug,
its a feature'' (having a semantics for every program is useful here).
However, the more common solution is to change the program!

<P>
Because this paper is partly concerned with how programmers think,
some qualification is in order.  I am not a psychologist and the ideas
here were not the result of a proper study of programmers.  In fact, I
believe most Prolog programmers think little or nothing of declarative
semantics (though perhaps with a better semantics this will change).
The ideas came mostly from introspection and are a refinement of the
work I have done over many years on reasoning about logic programs.
The intended meanings of programs in this paper are discussed and I
know the intended meanings because I wrote the programs.  I hope to
convince the reader that other programmers think in a similar way, or at
least this is a useful way to think about programs.  I believe my use
of declarative semantics has contributed to my logic
programming abilities.

<P>
The rest of the paper is structured as follows.  We first give a synopsis
for programmers: a concise non-technical description of a verification
method which arises out of our technical results.  The next section gives
more detailed motivation for our work, discussing how programmers intend
code to behave, how it actually behaves, reasoning about (in)correctness
and formal semantics.  It briefly reviews previous work on the semantics
of logic programs and declarative debugging (some knowledge of these areas
would help the reader).  We then present our three-valued semantics,
first for definite clause programs, then for programs with negation.
We define operational, model theoretic and fixpoint semantics and
establish various relationships between them.  Related work on semantics
is discussed in these sections.  Finally, we present examples of our
program verification method, comparing it with other work, then conclude.
