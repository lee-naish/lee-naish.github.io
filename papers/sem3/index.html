<H1>A three-valued semantics for Horn clause programs</H1>

The study of semantics of logic programs has shown strong links between
the model theoretic semantics (truth and falsity of atoms in the
programmer's interpretation of a program), procedural semantics (for
example, SLD resolution) and fixpoint semantics (which is
useful for program analysis and alternative execution mechanisms).
Nearly all of this work assumes that intended interpretations are
two-valued:
a ground atom is true (and should succeed according to the procedural
semantics) or false (and should not succeed).  In reality, intended
interpretations are less precise.
Programmers consider that some atoms "should not occur"
or are "ill-typed" or "inadmissible".  Programmers don't know and
don't
care whether such atoms succeed.  In this paper we propose a
three-valued semantics for (essentially) Horn clause programs which
reflects this.  It is simpler and more flexible than previously proposed
type schemes which implicitly recognise this third truth value.
It provides tools to reason about correctness of programs without the
need for unnatural precision or undue restrictions on programming style.
This work has been motivated by work on declarative debugging, where it
has been recognised that inadmissible calls are important.
