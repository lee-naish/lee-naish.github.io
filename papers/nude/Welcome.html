<hr>
This is a reasonably old paper, written before I started using Latex and
associated tools.
<A HREF="http://www.cs.mu.oz.au/~aet">Bert Thompson</A>
was able to reconstruct a Postscript
version which bears reasonable resemblance to the original paper or
technical report.  He also worked on producing a release of the
implementation of the system and wrote the manual.

One of the advantages of logic programming is that it is easy to
reason about what is computed by a program (the declarative semantics)
independently of how it is computed (the procedural semantics).
As well as being useful for writing, transforming and understanding
programs, these two alternative viewpoints are useful for testing
and debugging programs.  By taking full advantage of declarative and
procedural semantics, we anticipate that very powerful programming
environments can be constructed.
<P>
In this paper we describe the NU-Prolog Debugging Environment (NUDE)
which is currently under development.  NUDE has three main components.
First, several static program analysis tools are used for detecting
program errors such as simple typing mistakes, `type' errors, infinite
loops and floundering.  Second, dynamic tools are provided for
diagnosing incorrect behaviour of a query at run time.  There are tools
for diagnosing wrong answers, missing answers, infinite loops and
floundering.  Third, there is a mechanism for automatically testing
programs to detect queries with wrong or missing answers.
The three components are integrated into the NU-Prolog system,
supporting a rapid test-debug-recompile cycle.
