<h1>What is Pawns?</h1>

<p>
Pawns is a functional programming language. It supports algebraic data
types, polymorphism, higher order programming and pure declarative code.
It is also an imperative programming language. It supports pointers,
destructive update and a form of global variables.  It combines these
two programming paradigms in a
tricky way and ensures code that looks like a pure function definition
really behaves as a pure function, even if it calls imperative code with
"effects" for efficiency.
</p>

<h1>Why bother?</h1>

<p>
Pure functional programming allows concise high level code that you
can reason about very easily, so its a great way to program.  But there
are some things for which imperative code is simpler and <em>much</em>
more efficient (a factor of at least twenty, even with state of the art
functional programming language implementations).  For some applications
such a speed difference rules out functional programming being used,
which is a shame.  Besides, it just shouldn't be that way!  With Pawns
you can write most of your code in the pure functional style, but some
parts for which efficiency is critical can be coded in an imperative
style and the imperative code can be encapsulated in a declarative
interface.  Some other functional languages support this general idea but do
not encapsulate imperative code to the same extent - if a data structure
is built using imperative features it is forever "tainted" and cannot be
viewed in a purely functional way.
</p>

<h1>What are the key ideas?</h1>

<p>
A key challenge is to ensure code that uses imperative features behaves
in a purely functional way.  Pawns stands for "Pointer assignment
without nasty surprises".  In a language like C we can have code such as
<code>*ptr1 = val;</code> which changes what <code>ptr1</code> points to
and may also change what other variables point to.  One of the design
principles of Pawns is that if code can affect the value of a variable
(or depends on the variable), this should be obvious.  For example, a Pawns
statement can have the annotation <code>!ptr2</code> to indicate it may affect
variable <code>ptr2</code>.  Even imperative Pawns code avoids the problem
of subtle undocumented interactions which can occur in other languages.
</p>

<!-- There can also be subtle interractions via global -->
<!-- variables or other forms of "state". -->

<p>
Programming with pointers and destructive update requires the programmer
to understand pointer aliasing and sharing of data structures.  For such
code in Pawns, sharing information is declared. This provides documentation
and allows the compiler to understand
the sharing and check the declarations are correct.  As well as declaring
side-effects, the programmer declares what sharing may occur between
arguments when a function is called and what sharing may occur when it
returns.  By tracking possible sharing, the compiler can determine if
arguments of a
function can be updated during its execution.  If update is restricted to
variables that are local to the function execution, purely functional
behaviour is guaranteed.  For example, a data structure can be built
locally using an imperative style, then returned. Thus imperative code
can be encapsulated inside a declarative interface.  Pawns also supports
a mechanism to declare and use mutable state, similar to global
variables, which can also be encapsulated and allows a declarative
view of IO.
</p>

<p>
Pure functional programming is the default in Pawns.  Arbitrary sharing
of function arguments and results is possible and declaring the sharing
is not required but update of such data
structures is not allowed.  However, if enough extra declarations
and annotations are supplied, there are no restrictions on what can be
updated. All Pawns code is safe and all dependencies and
interractions are clear from the source code; the only exception is the
foreign language interface, which allows Pawns functions to be defined
by arbitrary C code and thus relies on the discipline of the programmer.

<h1>Related languages</h1>

<p> The <a href="http://www.discus-lang.org/">Discus</a> (previously
called Disciple) programming language supports similar low level
imperative features to Pawns.  It is, as far as we know, the only
other functional programming language that supports destructive
update of all arguments of all data constructors, even when the data
structure is shared.  It uses "region" information (what memory region
data constructors occupy) rather than sharing information to limit
interaction and effects.  Discus does more inference of region and side
effect information than is done in Pawns, so there is more potential for
"nasty surprises" and doesn't encapsulate effects to the same extent.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="http://mars-lang.appspot.com/">Mars</a> programming language
has "assignment without nasty surprises" but no explicit pointers.
Nasty surprises are avoided by copying data structures where necessary,
as determined by sharing analysis (similar to that done in Pawns).
Destructive update of shared data structures is not possible.  Programs
look imperative but the semantics is more like a pure functional language.
</p>

<p> The <a href="https://github.com/pschachte/wybe/">Wybe</a> programming
language is is similar to Mars in that it avoids "nasty surprises"  by
copying and supports assignment for data structures that the compiler
determines are definitely not shared.  It is influenced by the logic
programming paradigm, supporting predicates that describe the relationship
between different values.  The distinction between input (the value of
a variable is supplied) and output (a value is computed and assigned to
a variable) is made by annotations on the code rather than the position
within the code.
</p>

<p>
ML supports destructive update using data types containing
<code>ref</code> and Haskell's <code>STRef</code> monad is similar.
The type system limits interaction and effects.  This has similar
consequences to the Disciple approach with respect to nasty surprises
and encapsulation and can also lead to multiple versions of a data type
and extra indirection in the representation.
</p>

<p>
The scripting language <a
href="http://www.compuphase.com/pawn/pawn.htm">Pawn</a> has a similar
name to Pawns but they are not at all closely related in other respects.
Both are influenced by C.  Pawn started life as a cut-down version of
C and has no types or pointers (except it supports call by reference).
Pawns combines C-style pointers with a nice type system and other benefits
of pure functional programming.
