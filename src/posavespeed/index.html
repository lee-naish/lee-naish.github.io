<h1>A new average speed metric</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
The most commonly used metric for average speed of a bike ride (or other
activity) is vague, arbitrary and often gives a very poor indication of
effort. Here we propose an elegant alternative that is a better indication
of effort and is very easily computed.
</p>

<h2>Average Speed</h2>

<p>
Often in cycling we are interested in some measure
of our average speed over a ride or part thereof.  This simplest way to
do this is divide the distance travelled by the elapsed time. This is
rarely used because it it so influenced by breaks in the riding due to red
lights, getting more fluids (or getting rid of fluids), rests, lunch, etc.
</p>

<h2>Average active speed</h2>

<p>
Average "active" speed is a much more commonly used metric.  It is the
total distance travelled divided by the total active time. The notion
of active time is rather vague.  Typically there is some speed threshold
and if the speed is below that threshold it is generally not considered
active time. There may also be time threshold in the transition between
active and inactive time, so if the speed is low only briefly it is still
considered active time.  Different hardware and software combinations
on bike computers and activity tracking software have different ways
of computing average active speed. Any precise definition has arbitrary
thresholds, making it an unappealing hack for those who like elegance.
</p>

<p>
Average active speed is also a frustratingly poor measure of effort when
the speed is uneven.  Although time when you are stopped is (mostly)
discounted, moving very slowly (but above the threshold speed) for a
relatively short distance can have a significant effect on the average.
For example, if you do a flat ride at constant 30kph for 30km (1
hour) but also include 500m at 5kph (6 minutes), your average active
speed drops to 27.73kph (for simplicity we ignore accelleration and
decelleration). Riding 30.5km at 27.73kph is significantly less effort.
Similarly, average active speed greatly underestimates effort when
there are hills. Suppose you grind up a climb at 12.5kph for 40 minutes
(8.3km) then zoom back down at 50kph for 10 minutes (again, ignoring
accelleration). The average active speed (and average speed) metric
gives your climbing speed four times the weight of your descending speed
because climbing takes four times as long, resulting in a 20kph average.
</p>

<h2>Positional average speed</h2>

<p> Average speed can be viewed as taking the speed each second (or
suitably small time interval) of the ride and taking the average.
More technically, if we plot a curve of the speed versus time, the
average speed is the area under the curve divided by the total time.
Average active speed is the same except inactive periods are ignored. Our
proposed metric, "positional average speed", can be viewed as taking
the speed each metre (or suitably small distance interval) and taking
the average.  More technically, if we plot a curve of the speed versus
distance travelled, the positional average speed is the area under
the curve divided by the total distance.  When the speed is zero,
no distance is covered so stops are naturally ignored by this metric
without the need for arbitrary thresholds. It is also a better measure of
effort than average active speed. In the flat ride example given above,
the positional average speed is 29.51kph.  For the hilly ride, equal
weight is given to the climbing and descending speed, giving an average
of 31.25kph. It's hard to measure overall effort without additional
information such as power output, but it seems positional average speed
gives a significantly better indication than average active speed.
If speed does not vary at all, average speed and positional average speed
are identical, otherwise positional average speed is stricty greater.
</p>

<h2>Computing average speed metrics</h2>

<p> For any metric, it is advantageous if it can be computed in "real
time", updating a display on a bike computer, using minimal storage and
computational resources.  Data such as position and time are typically
sampled at frequent intervals and speed is computed from these (using some
method that attempts to overcome the significant noise in GPS position
data) or other inputs. Average speed can be computed by regularly reading
the speed and using just two accumulators: the sum of all speed readings
so far and the number of speed readings.  The average speed is the former
divided by the latter.  For average active speed, inactive periods
can be ignored (with some suitable simple calculation of inactive).
Positional average speed can also be computed using two accumulators:
the sum of all the speed readings and the the sum of the squares of all
the speed readings. The positional average speed is the latter divided
by the former. Technically, such sampling methods are essentially a form
of numerical integration, which results in an approximation to the true
value. However, the position and speed data contains significant noise,
so approximation is inevitable.
</p>

<h2>Experimentation with gpx files</h2>

<p> We have written <a href="./avespeed.txt"> a simple script</a> that
uses <a href="https://www.gpsbabel.org"> <code>gpsbabel</code></a> to
read gpx files and compute speed data, which is then used to compute
the average speed metrics.  The most difficult challenge is finding
an appropriate way of smoothing the noisey gpx data to the computed
speeds are reasonably accurate.  We use the "distance" parameter of
<code>gpsbabel</code> to filter out data points that are close together.
It seems that most of the bike computer hardware and software systems
use proprietary methods to smooth the data in some way.
