<h1>Equivalent Speed: An improved average speed metric</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p> The most commonly used metric for average speed of a bike ride
(or other activity) is vague, arbitrary and often gives a very poor
indication of effort. This page describes an elegant alternative that
is a much better indication of effort and is very easily computed. It
has been implemented in the <a href="https://www.sauce.llc/">Sauce
for Strava</a> browser extension, which adds functionality
to the <a href="https://www.strava.com/">Strava web site</a>
(at the time of writing, it is in the <a
href="https://github.com/SauceLLC/sauce4strava/"> github site</a>
and should be in an official release soon). It may have more
widespread use in the future.
</p>

<h2>Average Speed</h2>

<p>
Often in cycling we are interested in some measure
of our average speed over a ride or part thereof.  The simplest way to
do this is divide the distance travelled by the elapsed time. This is
rarely used because it it so influenced by breaks in the riding due to red
lights, getting more fluids (or getting rid of fluids), rests, lunch, etc.
</p>

<h2>Average active speed</h2>

<p>
Average "active" speed is a much more commonly used metric.  It is the
total distance travelled divided by the total active time. The notion
of active time is rather vague.  Typically there is some speed threshold
and if the speed is below that threshold it is generally not considered
active time. There may also be time threshold in the transitions between
active and inactive time, so if the speed is low only briefly it is still
considered active time.  Different hardware and software combinations
on bike computers and activity tracking software have different ways
of computing average active speed. Any precise definition has arbitrary
thresholds, making it an unappealing hack for those who like elegance.
</p>

<p>
Average active speed is also a frustratingly poor measure of effort when
the speed is uneven.  Although time when you are stopped is (mostly)
discounted, moving very slowly (but above the threshold speed) for a
relatively short distance can have a significant effect on the average.
For example, if you do a flat ride at constant 30kph for 30km (1
hour) but also include 500m at 5kph (6 minutes), your average active
speed drops to 27.73kph (for simplicity, ignore accelleration and
decelleration). Riding 30.5km at 27.73kph is significantly less effort.
Similarly, average active speed greatly underestimates effort when
there are hills. Suppose you grind up a climb at 12.5kph for 40 minutes
(8.3km) then zoom back down at 50kph for 10 minutes (again, ignoring
acceleration). The average active speed (and average speed) metric
gives your climbing speed four times the weight of your descending speed
because climbing takes four times as long, resulting in a 20kph average
(despite being much more effort than a flat 20kph ride of the same
distance).
</p>

<h2>Equivalent Speed (ES)</h2>

<p> Average speed can be viewed as taking the speed each second (or
suitably small time interval) of the ride and taking the average.
More technically, if we plot a curve of the speed versus time, the
average speed is the area under the curve divided by the total time.
Average active speed is the same except inactive periods are ignored.
Equivalent Speed can be viewed as taking
the speed each metre (or suitably small distance interval) and taking
the average.
More technically, if we plot a curve of the speed versus
distance travelled, ES is the area under
the curve divided by the total distance.  When the speed is zero,
no distance is covered so stops are naturally ignored by this metric
without the need for arbitrary thresholds. It is also a <em>much</em>
better measure of
effort than average active speed. In the flat ride example given above,
ES is 29.51kph.  For the hilly ride, equal
weight is given to the climbing and descending speed, so ES is 31.25kph.
If speed does not vary at all, average speed and ES
are identical, otherwise ES is strictly greater.
</p>

<h2>Computing average speed metrics</h2>

<p> For any metric, it is advantageous if it can be computed in "real
time", updating a display on a bike computer, using minimal storage and
computational resources.  Data such as position and time are typically
sampled at frequent intervals and speed is computed from these
and/or other data. Average speed can be computed by regularly reading
the speed and using just two accumulators: the sum of all speed readings
so far and the number of speed readings.  The average speed is the former
divided by the latter.  For average active speed, inactive periods
can be ignored (with some suitable simple calculation of inactive).
ES can also be computed using two accumulators:
the sum of all the speed readings and the the sum of the squares of all
the speed readings. ES is the latter divided
by the former. Technically, such sampling methods are essentially a form
of numerical integration, which results in an approximation to the true
value. However, the raw data is not completely accurate in any case
so approximation is inevitable.
</p>

<h2>History</h2>

<p> Quite a few years ago the idea of ES came to me (I called
it positional average speed) and eventually
created the original version of this web page and did <a
href="./avespeed.txt"> a primitive implementation</a> for analysis
of gpx files that didn't include explicit speed data.  In 2024
I found out Scott Bollt also had the same idea years ago and published <a
href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Scott-Bollt/publication/353625461_Equivalent_Speed_A_New_Metric_For_Cycling_Performance_95/links/61e077135779d35951a62c4b/Equivalent-Speed-A-New-Metric-For-Cycling-Performance-95.pdf">
a paper</a> about it. This paper used the term Equivalent Speed (ES) and
showed it is a very good approximation of effort under various conditions
(another even more accurate metric was proposed also). Scott and I
communicated, he mentioned Sauce4Strava, I did the initial implementation
and that was adapted for the official version.  I have made suggestions
for its incorporation into other platforms.
