This directory contains the last release of MU-Prolog.  It is not
supported and is very much out of date.  It should be of interest only
for historical purposes or to run the few MU-Prolog applications that
have never been ported to a more modern Prolog.  It is unlikely to be
of any use for anything else.

MU-Prolog is provided "as is."  It remains the property of The
University of Melbourne and its authors.  The University of Melbourne
and its authors make absolutely no representations about its
suitability for any purpose.  (Well, we do say that it might sort of be
a Prolog implementation, but you should form your own opinions about
that.)

You may copy MU-Prolog provided that you

	a) Inform Lee Naish (lee@unimelb.edu.au).
	b) Do not charge others to use it.
	c) Do not further distribute it in any form.
