The
<A HREF="http://www.cs.kuleuven.ac.be/~iclp97/cfp.html">Call For Papers</A>
contains general information about the scope of the conference and the
low-tech submission procedure.  However, its probably easier for
everyone, including you, to use a bit more technology.
<P>
<H2>Kinds of submissions</H2>
I am allowing three kinds of submissions:
<OL>
<LI> Hardcopy (multiple copies sent via snail-mail),
<LI> Postscript file sent via e-mail, and
<LI> Uuencoded DVI file sent via e-mail.
</OL>

The advantage of electronic submissions is they can be transmitted much
more quickly and cheaply.  You could, for example, spend the weekend
working on your submission and e-mail it some time on Sunday December 1st
and still make the deadline.  The disadvantage is that formats are not
completely portable.  For this reason, a backup hardcopy must be send in
the mail (you have to send a letter anyway), though it does not have to
arrive by the December 1st deadline.
<P>

<H2>Registering submissions</H2>
I am requesting that <em>all</em> people submitting papers register
their submission via the Web.  If you want to submit via e-mail you
<strong>must</strong> register your submission via the Web.
To register a submission, point your Web browser at
<strong>
<A HREF="http://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/lee/iclp97/iclpreg.html">this form</A></strong>,
fill in the details of your paper (title etc), the type of submission,
and your contact details and submit the form.  Your browser will then
display a covering letter which you can print, sign and include with
your hardcopy submission.
<P>
<H2>Electronic submissions</H2>
The aim is to minimise the number of papers which can be printed by the
authors but cannot be printed when they arrive in Melbourne or wherever
the referees are (which could be anywhere in the world).  Experts on
non-portability of Postscript/DVI are quite rare it seems (if you are
one please let <A HREF="mailto:iclp97@cs.mu.oz.au">me</A> know!) so the
following guidelines are based rumours rather than fact.
<P>
<UL>
<LI>
If you are using Latex without encapsulated Postscript then submit a
uuencoded DVI file - although DVI is officially not as standard as
Postscript it can actually be more portable.
<LI>
If possible, try printing on A4 sized paper rather than USA letter
size.  Printing on A4 paper on an Apple LaserWriter II would be ideal.
<LI>
Use reasonably large margins - I would prefer a paper which can print
but is slightly over the page limit to one which cannot be printed.
Note that the (strict) page limit on the final version of the paper will
be shorter than the page limit on submissions so it wouldn't hurt to
shorten your paper before its submitted!
<LI>
Avoid obscure fonts.
<LI>
Check your e-mail regularly after submitting.  If we can't print your
submission we might ask that you try sending a different format.
</UL>
