HTML has a form facility with quite a few neato features.
There is a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) defined between these forms and
other code.  Perl is a common language for interfacing with forms;
C is sometimes used also.  Here is some code which interfaces NU-Prolog
with HTML forms.  I should add the disclaimer that I don't know much
about HTML or CGI.  I'm probably doing some things the "wrong"
way, but nevertheless, it works!

Check out this
<A HREF="formnp.html">form</A>
which illustrates most of the features of HTML forms.
You fill in the form, hit the "Submit Form" button and another page pops up.
What creates that page?
<A HREF="prform.nl.txt">This</A>
NU-Prolog program.
<P>

How is the connection specified?  The form specifies that the ACTION is
<A HREF="nptest.txt"> "http://www.cs.mu.oz.au/us/cgi-bin/nptest"</A>.
This is the file produced by compiling the program above using the
NU-Prolog compiler nc.  The compiler output must be very slightly
modified for the interface to work properly - see the comment in the file.

has also done some related work with Sicstus Prolog and developed the
<A HREF="http://www.clip.dia.fi.upm.es/miscdocs/pillow/pillow.html">
PiLLoW library</A>.  Actually, lots of
people have now done this kind of thing - there have been ICLP conference
workshops on WWW and I'm sure they will continue.
