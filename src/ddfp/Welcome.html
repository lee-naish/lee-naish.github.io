<A HREF="../../papers/eq/">
NUE-Prolog</A>
is a combined relational plus functional language supporting higher
order functions and lazy evaluation as well as full NU-Prolog, including
coroutining.  It is an extension of
NU-Prolog which allows evaluable functions to be defined.  It is
implemented by transformation into standard NU-Prolog.
<P>

The declarative debugger for the functional part of the language is
implemented by modifying the transformation so that functions return a
representation of the computation performed as well as the final result
of evaluation.  The debugger evaluates a functional expression and if
the result is wrong the representation of the computation is used to
query the user and find what function definition is buggy.

To run it you will need a copy of

NU-Prolog</A>
(maybe there will be a portable version some day)
