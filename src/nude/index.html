NU-Prolog Debugging Environment (NUDE)

<hr>

NUDE is described in a paper entitled
<A HREF="../../papers/nude/">The NU-Prolog debugging environment</A>.
This version of NUDE is reasonably stable but doesn't contain all
features described in
<A HREF="http://www.cs.mu.oz.au/publications/tr_db/mu_96_38.ps.gz">
the manual</A>.
It is also not "idiot proof" - if you try to use it for things it wasn't
designed for it will be confusing.  The most common example of this is
trying to use the declarative debugger for code which is not
declarative/pure.
A version with more features exists but its stability is questionable.
Hopefuly this will be made available here some time.  Work on
programming environments here is now more active with
<A HREF="http://www.cs.mu.oz.au/research/mercury/">
Mercury</A>
than
<A HREF="../nuprolog/">
NU-Prolog</A>.
