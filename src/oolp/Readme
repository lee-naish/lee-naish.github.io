This is a simple object oriented extension to Prolog, mostly hacked
together by Lee Naish rather quicky.  It works as a preprocessor.

Check out sample.op and tweety.op for (breif) examples of the syntax/features.

The way to use the system is to load oop.pl and util.pl into a
Quintus-like Prolog system.  Your object
oriented prolog program should have a .op file extension.  To preprocess
it then compile and load it type ``ooc(file)''.

The tech report gives more information on the language and
implementation:
