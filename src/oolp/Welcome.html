NUOO-Prolog is a simple object oriented extension to NU-Prolog, mostly hacked
together by Lee Naish rather quicky.  It works as a preprocessor.
Check out
the (brief) examples below for some of the syntax/features.
One of the
nice things about the system is that
its "pure" in the sense it can easily be given clear declarative
semantics.  A prototype declarative debugger has been implemented.
The down side is that objects can't have mutable state.
The
<A HREF="../../papers/oolp/">
tech report
</A>
gives more information on the language and
implementation.  The tech report describes a version implemented on top
of Quintus Prolog.  The version here has some improvements such as
parameterised objects.  I also have an implementation of further
enhancements such as supporting separate compilation and various forms
of multiple inheritance.
<P>
I have certainly found it of use for knowledge bases I have had to
maintain.
Examples include coordinating honours and other fourth year courses where
there are students, thesis topics, supervisors etc, and coordinating the
technical programme of the
<A HREF="http://www.cs.kuleuven.ac.be/~iclp97/">ICLP'97</A>
conference (paper submissions, reviews etc).

Examples

<UL>

<LI>
The famous Tweety:
<A HREF="tweety.op.txt">
tweety.op
</A>
(preprocessed to become
<A HREF="tweety.nl.txt">
tweety.nl</A>)

<LI>
Objects with parameters:
<A HREF="shape.op.txt">
shape.op
</A>
(preprocessed to become
<A HREF="shape.nl.txt">
shape.nl</A>)

<LI>
A boring example from the paper:
<A HREF="sample.op.txt">
sample.op
</A>
(preprocessed to become
<A HREF="sample.nl.txt">
sample.nl</A>)

Source code

<UL>

<LI>
<A HREF="./nuooprolog.tar.gz">
Source code (gzipped tar file)</A>

<LI>
<A HREF="./dougl.tgz">
Source code (tar/gzipped file)</A> of version with additional features 
such as multiple inheritance

<LI>
To run it you will need a copy of
<A HREF="../nuprolog">
NU-Prolog
</A>.
Actually the code is so short (around 300 lines) and simple you
should be able to port it to any Unix-based Prolog easily.
