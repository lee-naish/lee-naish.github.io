<h1>Algorithms in Action</h1>

<p> Algorithms in Action (AIA) is an award winning algorithm animation
system.  It displays views of data structures in sync with highlighting
lines of pseudocode as they execute. Sounds familiar, right? However, a
<em>unique</em> feature is that the pseudocode can be viewed at different
levels of abstraction, and the animation details adjust accordingly. For
example, at the highest level of abstraction, Heap Sort can be described
in just two lines of pseudocode: first, convert the unsorted array into a
heap, then convert the heap into a sorted array.  The animation proceeds
in just two steps, displaying both the array and tree views so the heap
structure is clearer. There is also a textual background explaining
the algorithm and explanations attached to the lines of pseudocode.
Lines of pseudocode can be <em>expanded</em> to reveal more code details and
the animation then has more steps and displays more detailed information.
</p>

<p> Stepwise refinement key to is how we explain algorithms, how we
develop algorithms and how we write code.  To be a good programmer you
must use abstraction (both procedural and data abstraction). One of the
things I really like about the AIA design is how it reinforces forms
of abstraction.  Students use AIA to learn about particular algorithms,
but in the process they learn valuable lessons about how to think like
a good programmer.
</p>

<p> AIA was first developed many years ago under the supervision
of Linda Stern, Harald Sondergaard and myself, using a very early
version of Java. It was gradually left behind as Java developed.
The current system is a re-implementation of the original core ideas
using Javascript and more modern software infrastructure (the React
framework and Node.js). The core was developed by final year software
engineering students and multiple students groups have contributed extra
functionality over the years.  More recently, I have been involved in
coding to improve/extend functionality and remove some long-standing bugs.
