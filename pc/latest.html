<h2>Vaccinations, Fatigue, and the Last(???) Lockdowns 27/12/2021</h2>
<a name="PSA0.5a"></a>
<a name="PSA0.55"></a>
<a name="PSA0.72"></a>
<a name="PSA1.11"></a>

<p> I've been seeing my oncologist every six weeks (mostly via
tele-health) and my PSA has continued to be low, but follow an exponential
growth pattern: 0.5, 0.55, 0.72, 1.11. I've not changed medication but on
my latest visit it was decided another scan was warranted. It's possible
there is a small tumour that is responsible for the PSA rise and can be
treated with radiation. I'll know more next month. The prospect of the
next stage of treatment is confronting but I'm assured there are many
more options available and I have lived with generally excellent health
over eight years since being diagnosed - far longer than expected at
the time.  </p>

<p> I had intended to write blog entries to chart all my health news in a
timely fashion but I guess I have been a little depressed over the last
six months. Melbourne had it's fifth lockdown, soon followed by it's
sixth, making it the most locked down city in the world. Vaccines for
Covid eventually became widely available and now over 90% of Australians
over the age of 15 have been vaccinated. There is still a small but
vocal group of anti-vaccination people, including ex-friends of ours,
and some people are reluctant for a variety of reasons (some of them
questionable).  For me there was never any question of whether to get
vaccinated - it is clearly the right thing to do in order to minimize
the suffering caused by this virus. It was also in my interest - before
vaccines became available the death rate due to Covid for those with
cancer was one in thirty.
</p>

<p> Unfortunately, I didn't tolerate the vaccines well. They caused
a resurgence of my CFS/ME. After each vaccination (I've had three so
far) it has taken around a month to fully recover. The first two were
particularly hard work. The way to get over fatigue, in my experience,
is exercise. You have to force your body to exercise even when it
screams for rest, but too much exercise makes things worse. After many
decades of practice I think I am reasonably good, though not perfect,
at this balancing act. The figure below shows the times and estimated
average power for riding laps near my home on June 22nd. At first it
was my slowest lap ever and around a quarter of my best power output for
that loop, despite pushing my body hard. As the ride progressed my body
performed better and my power output doubled. The next day it was
better still.
</p>

</center>

<p> With fatigue and lockdowns it has been a challenge maintaining my
health and fitness. To avoid bouts of more severe depression during
lockdowns I found I needed to ride around 30km every day but long rides
were impossible so my fitness gradually declined. With higher vaccination
rates, and the difficulty containing the Delta variant of Covid, and now
the Omicron variant, restrictions have eased and we are told there will be
no more lockdowns. I'm not entirely confident in this assertion. Over the
course of this pandemic, many millions of people have been told by their
political leaders (particularly from the conservative end of politics)
there will be no (more) lockdowns, only to be locked down when case
numbers surge and the health system looks likely to be overwhelmed.
My family has remained Covid-free, though there have been a couple of
times when one of us has isolated due to possible exposure, including on
Christmas day. We have been quite conservative with taking advantage of
eased restrictions. I regained some fitness, mostly with solo rides, and
ticked off my annual 300km ride (with a friend again this year). It was
more of a struggle than I had hoped - I think I had not fully recovered
from my third vaccination. Otherwise my health is pretty good and my
specialist GP was happy to make our appointments yearly instead of every
six months.

<h2>Seeing the enemy 16/2/2022</h2>
<a name="PSA1.79"></a>

<p>
At the end of last month I had a PET scan and saw my oncologist the next
day.  I also had PSA test results - up significantly again to 1.79, so
the cancer is definitely actively growing at a rather alarming rate.
However, the PET scan results were as good as we could have hoped for.
It showed just a single tumour, in the prostate - see the photo below
(the scan shows up several organs such as kidneys, bladder and salivary
glands; the tumour is the small spot at the bottom, just below the
bladder).
</p>

<center>
<img src="./pet_scan_2022.jpg" width="40%"
alt="PET scan image on computer monitor showing various organs and tumour">
</center>

<p> Seeing the PET scan (and the jump in PSA) made me feel that death was
closer, but I also felt a bit relieved as well. Sometimes if you can see
"the enemy" it is easier to deal with than the unknown - it gives the
illusion of more control at least.  My oncologist was encouraged by
the PET scan. There are no doubt plenty of cancer cells still spread
around my body but for the most part, they are being controlled by my
medication and lack of testosterone. There is only one place where they
are growing in a uncontrolled way. The hope is the tumour can be killed
off in some way, turning back the clock somewhat in the progression of
the disease. If such a tumour had been discovered in me ten years or
more ago, before the cancer had spread, it would definitely have been
treated. Had it been found five years ago, it is doubtful it would have
been treated since it was known the cancer had spread and just killing
off a bit of it in an area that doesn't cause significant damage can do
more harm than good. However, because I have survived over eight years
in generally good health and most of the cancer is well controlled,
treating the tumour may well be worth the harm/risk. My oncologist said
he would discuss my case with other experts and refer me to a relatively
young and not so conservative radiation oncologist who may be convinced
that radiotherapy to kill the tumour is worthwhile. I have a tele-health
appointment tomorrow.  </p>

<p> I feel very lucky to have access to such expert medical care. I'm one
of the "haves", both in terms of having cancer but also wealth and access
to excellent medicine. I'm amazed by how much science and technology is
behind my care. In the basement of the Peter Mac. Cancer Center there
is a cyclotron, which accelerates charged particles to around half the
speed of light. These smash atoms apart to produce a radioactive isotope
of Florine, which is separated and combined with another carefully
constructed chemical than binds strongly to another chemical found
on the cell membrane of prostate cancer cells. I was injected with
this radioactive chemical.  It seemed slightly incongruous that it was
delivered to my room in a somewhat stained brass-covered lead container
that would not look out of place in the laboratory of an alchemist from
hundreds of years ago (the lead stops most of the radiation and the
brass prevents lead poisoning). After waiting for the chemical to circulate
through my body and bind to prostate cancer cells, I was put in the PET
scan machine. Inside my body, the Florine atoms were decaying - protons
in the nucleus were turning into neutrons plus positrons (the anti-matter
equivalent of electrons) - the alchemists were not that far off after
all! The positrons soon bump into an electron (they have opposite charges
and are thus attracted to each other) but matter and anti-matter don't
mix. Both particles are annihilated and two gamma ray photons shoot off
at the speed of light in opposite directions (yes, my body was giving
off gamma rays because anti-matter was being created within it). The
gamma rays are detected by the PET scan machine and complicated computer
algorithms are used to create a 3D image of the body showing where the
radioactive Florine has concentrated. Pretty amazing stuff! </p>

<h2>On-track for off-piste 17/2/2022</h2>

<p> My partner and I had an online chat with the radiation oncologist this
morning. There were a bunch of questions about my history (including
correcting an error in the records for when I had my orchiectomy -
a good thing I maintain this blog), symptoms and checking for things
for which radiotherapy could pose an extra risk.  The oncologists had
discussed my case (it seems like I'm a bit of a local legend as far as
defying the odds) and there was a consensus that radiotherapy was a good
option. As I mentioned in the previous post, this is orthodox for early
stages of prostate cancer but in my case the oncologist described it
as "off-piste". Few people survive metastatic prostate cancer as well
as I have so there is no data about the risks versus benefits of this
treatment for someone in my position. Two options were mentioned. One
involved inserting gold targets into the tumour then having a relatively
short but intense series of radiation treatments.  The other (preferred)
option was twenty less intense radiation treatments (five days per
week for four weeks) - rather more than I expected.  The overall dose
was discussed by the oncologists and a compromise between killing off
the tumour and side-effects was made. A higher dose would normally be
used to make sure no cancer survives but in my case there is cancer
elsewhere so total destruction of the tumour is less important.
Side-effects include tiredness and irritation of the bladder and bowel
(lasting for a few weeks) plus there is a risk of scar tissue forming
blockages and ongoing problems. During treatment I would be put on a
"low residue" diet to minimise bowel contents and allow the tumour to
be targeted with less bowel damage. It is rather scary and I do have
some dread of each new step along the path but I said to go ahead. I
am hopeful the treatment will go smoothly and turn the clock back a
bit with the progression of the disease while maintaining the existing
armoury of treatment options. So, in around a week I will be measured
up, the radiation oncologist will design the course of treatment and a
couple of weeks later I'll start the radiotherapy.  </p>

<h2>A new lease of life? 31/5/22</h2>
<a name="PSA2.43"></a>
<a name="PSA0.37a"></a>

<p> My course of radiotherapy went reasonably smoothly. It was slightly
stressful due to the requirement that my bowels should be as empty as
possible but my bladder should be full, but not too full.  Five days
a week I would jump on my bike, ride to the hospital, check in, change
into a gown and when called in I would be positioned on the machine (on
my first "measure up" visit I was given four small tattoos so I could be
lined up accurately) and the zapping would commence (assuming bowel and
bladder constraints were met). In the best case I would be back home within
an hour. Living close to a good cancer hospital has benefits. I was rather
concerned about side-effects.  I pushed myself to ride a bit more before
the treatment. Towards the end I didn't feel great, there were a few
urgent trips to the toilet, there were a few days I was extra tired and
I'm still getting up to urinate during the night with slightly annoying
frequency. However, I still managed a 100km ride every week.  </p>

<p> I had a phone consultation with the radiation oncologist soon after
treatment to check on side-effects and a week or so ago we had a face
to face meeting (around six weeks after the treatment). Just before the
treatment I had another PSA test - it had risen significantly again,
to 2.43. Since treatment it has fallen to 0.37. Around a year ago I had
the same PSA reading. It was rather a shock and signalled the start of
the distressing rise. This time it should continue to head in the other
direction because the peak effectiveness of radiotherapy can be a year or
even more after treatment, as the damaged DNA of the cancer cells leads
to further cell death. My radiation oncologist mentioned the possibility
that my PSA could drop low enough that I may be able to stop taking my
current medication. He then backtracked a bit, saying we should not get
ahead of ourselved and we should take things one step at a time. I took
it as a very positive sign anyway.  At least the oncologists seem very
happy and hopeful about my medium term prospects whereas a year ago they
were apologetic. I've also been feeling a bit more healthy recently. Its
possibly just in my head (though my mental health is still a bit fragile)
but I was told the tumour was around the size of a golf ball and given
that it was also growing rapidly it may have affected my general health
noticibly. Overall, I'm very happy to have had the radiotherapy and am
hopeful it will extend my life significantly.  </p>

<p> I can't finish this blog entry without mentioning two other things -
one negative and one positive. The first is the brutal invasion of the
Ukraine by Putin's Russia. The expectation of many was it would be a
quick war, with the might of the Russian military. However, with over
three months of fighting, bombardments etc the Russian gains are modest
but the suffering is immense. Civilians have been targetted, cluster
bombs used and mines left by retreating Russian soldiers (both cluster
bombs and mines are illegal under international law). The West, including
Australia, have provided military and humanitarian support but avoided
direct intervention. It is hard to know whats best to do to avoid and
react to such behaviour. I feel rather powerless, though I have donated
more to MSF. The positive note is the outcome of the recent Australian
federal election. The Liberal Party, leaders of the government for almost
a decade, have had a resounding defeat. I have little but contempt for
several of their senior members, including the ex-Prime Minister. Years
of federal government inaction of climate change (and most other things
for that matter) should now come to an end. For the first time I donated
money to help an election campaign - Climate 200 raised money to help
independent candidates campaign against conservatives in several key
contests. They were remarkably successful, though the ideal outcome
where MPs who support strong climate action held the balance of power
has not been achieved. Still, I welcome the change in government.  </p>

<h2>Disappointment, fear and avoidance 8/12/22 </h2>
<a name="PSA0.68"></a>

<p> It was September 29th when I saw yet another oncologist and
received the news that my PSA hadn't continued to fall as predicted,
but had significantly risen again, to 0.68. I felt slightly angry and
have delayed writing another blog entry until now, another sign that
I had trouble processing the news. Beneath the anger was surely fear,
but it is a reminder that managing expectations is important, for both
giving and receiving information. Prior to this result I felt I had a
reprieve and was more relaxed about my medium term prospects, letting
my guard down. I think many people don't handle fear well. It's tough
confronting the thing that we are really afraid of and we often find ways
of avoiding it (such as denial) or redirecting the fear.  I think for
many, the fear of COVID paradoxically morphed into a fear of vaccines
and a whole other world of conspiracies. The echo chambers of social
media and innate tribalism bring such people together (and separate
them from people such as myself), and some seek to manipulate or take
advantage of this (politicians, for example).  There is certainly ample
anger displayed by those who have opposed public health measures. The
emotion beneath the surface is surely fear.  Fortunately, the state
election held recently showed how small this noisy minority is. The
opposition and media pushed the narrative that our (now re-elected)
Premier was divisive but although there certainly was division, it was
caused by COVID and how people reacted to it. But the noisy minority
has had some influence it seems.  There are no mask mandates except
for limited health care settings, so people who are immuno-compromised
are very restricted in what they can safely do.  I've not caught public
transport or gone to a movie since early this year and rarely catch up
with friends. While many people have returned to a life rather like it
was before COVID and the term "post-pandemic" is popular, many of us
with dysfunctional immune systems would prefer more restrictions.
</p>

<p> At least with voluntary assisted dying, the fear of a "bad" death is
reduced. My friend Nia Sims, who I met through VAD around five years ago,
also passed away through VAD. I was not particularly close to her but she
impressed me with her strength, honesty and caring.  The conversations
I had when I visited her were very special. Another friend of hers
produced <a
href="https://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/earshot/voluntary-assisted-dying-meet-me-in-the-middle-of-the-air/14108318">
this</a> very moving (and confronting) pod-cast. Another friend of mine,
a former Ph.D. student, also tragically passed away due to complications
following surgery for colon cancer. He had a great mind, was a keen
cyclist and believed in trying to make the world a better place.
</p>

<p> It has been a pretty hard winter and spring for me.  The cold, wet
weather started early and I didn't do much riding. There have been bouts
of depression and fatigue. I delayed getting my fourth COVID immunisation
but eventually relented. Bad side-effects from COVID vaccinations
for people who suffer from CFS/ME seem to have more recognition in
New Zealand, where medical advice is to take antihistamines with the
vaccination. Unfortunately it didn't appear to help me. It took a month
to get over the worst of the fatigue and it was just under two months
before I had a day with a glimmer of energy - something that is still
sadly rare. I'm sure that the fatigue contributes to my depression (and
depression also reduces energy levels), but I have also had a couple
of episodes of anxiety - most unpleasant. Getting my fitness back to
a good level has been very hard work. At times, riding laps around a
local circuit has brought me to tears, forcing my body to work when it's
screaming it doesn't want to - my own special torture but it seems to
work. At other times I've ridden all day battling against the constant
weight of fatigue. When I first started road cycling I remember people
would ask if it was for my health and the answer was no - I was riding
primarily for pleasure but with health benefits as a bonus. Nowadays,
a lot of my riding is primarily for health and fitness.
</p>

<p> I have my fitness back though, and do have times when I really enjoy
the riding. A couple of weeks ago I did my annual 300+km ride, up two
hills familiar to Melbourne cyclists: Arthur's Seat (a significant ride
to the south) and Kinglake (a significant ride to the north). On a clear
day you can just see one from the other in the far distance (see the photo
below, taken on the ride). My most enjoyable (and also very tough) recent
ride was a couple of days ago with a friend from Tasmania who I hadn't
seen since before COVID hit. It was a loop that included Kinglake, Mt.
Donna Buang and Mt. Dandenong.
</p>

</center>

<p> Next week I see the oncologist again. I fear my PSA will continue
to double at a similar rate to last year, but at least the radiotherapy
seems to have given me another year of life. I feel I should say more
in this blog entry: about the recent awful floods (though personally,
the wet cooler weather makes some things easier), about my ever-loving
and supportive partner, about my daughter (currently studying overseas),
about the state of the world. But I just want to get it over and done
with, to relieve the pressure I put on myself. I hope to add the latest
PSA result in a few days. Fingers crossed!
</p>

<h2>Bye-bye bicalutamide 13/12/22 </h2>
<a name="PSA1.61"></a>

<p> At least I was more prepared for a bad result this time, though it
was even worse than expected - 1.61. I'm pretty sure thats the worst
percentage increase I've had. I don't feel too bad about it, though
perhaps it will hit me soon (I just got the result this afternoon).
The PSA decrease after radiotherapy was better than the oncologists
expected, but the subsequent increase has been worse. I'm stopping my
daily bicalutamide tablet, after over three and a half years. It may
actually be making things worse (I feel that is quite likely) and my PSA
may go down for a while - it drops by 50% or more in 15-30% of cases. It
may be that codon 741 in the gene for the androgen receptor in some of
my prostate cancer cells has mutated (a single base pair in the whole
genome) and that makes the difference between bicalutamide hindering
or helping the cancer. I'm also getting another PSMA PET scan early
next year. My oncologist was a bit concerned there might be a long wait
for a requested scan. I was assured that I was just offered the first
available appointment and that the supporting note from an additional
oncologist plus the mention of the fundraising I have done for Peter Mac
(my name will appear on the fundraising honour board) didn't result in
me jumping the queue ahead of more needy patients. Onwards, with hope...
</p>


<h2>Bye-bye side-effects 22/12/22 </h2>

<p> I wasn't expecting to write another blog entry so soon. I had a
bone density scan (a significant drop for my left hip but a good result
for my spine and overall nothing to be too worried about) but stopping
bicalutamide seems to have resulted in other health changes. With the bad
PSA result, continuing cool wet weather and not much cycling I expected
I would have another bout of depression but I didn't. In fact, I felt
<em>much</em> better. I did get rather tired and sleepy, but it didn't
feel the same as my CFS/ME fatigue. I think my body has been adjusting
to being drug-free and I'm sure the bicalutamide was having significant
psychological side-effects that I was not aware of. After I started
taking it I noted "feeling less confident and more fearful" and believe
my recent poor mental health (depression and a couple of episodes of
anxiety) has been, in part, due to bicalutamide. Yesterday morning, for
the first time in ages, I got up around 5am to meet with my fast friends
on their regular Mordialloc ride. I was sure I would not be able to keep
up with them riding at 40+kph for the 20km back to St. Kilda, but with
the help of a few well-timed red lights I finished with the front bunch.
I was able to put out a good amount of power for short bursts, something
I haven't felt able to do for quite a while. I'm hopeful that recent
fatigue is partly due to the bicalutamide and perhaps even the activity
of the cancer, and that feeling better physically is a positive sign
that the cancer will be less active for a while without bicalutamide.
Whatever the future brings, it's nice to feel a bit more happy with
life. I even wrote a song on a recent solo ride, when I had the tune of
Oh Christmas Tree stuck in my brain - it amused my oncologist at least
(cosudex is the brand name of the bicalutamide tablets I was taking):</p>

<pre>
Oh cosudex, Oh cosudex,
I loved you once. Now you're my ex.
It was three years and almost four
but now I'm glad you're out the door.
Oh cosudex, Oh cosudex,
I loved you once. Now you're my ex.

My lips embraced you every day.
You may want more but there's no way.
My enemy is now your friend
so our relationship must end.
Oh cosudex, Oh cosudex,
I loved you once. Now you're my ex.

My daily bicalutamide
you are no longer on my side.
You used to fight but now just play.
As evidence: my PSA.
Oh cosudex, Oh cosudex,
I loved you once. Now you're my ex.

The cells divide and they evolve
a problem we are yet to solve.
There may have been a mutation
in codon seven forty one.
Oh cosudex, Oh cosudex,
I loved you once. Now you're my ex.

You did some good but, no offence,
you really sapped my confidence.
I didn't know it at the time -
I blamed it on COVID one nine.
Oh cosudex, Oh cosudex,
I loved you once. Now you're my ex.

Oh cosudex, Oh cosudex,
I loved you once. Now you're my ex.
The pain I feel seems far away.
It's so much less than yesterday.
Oh cosudex, Oh cosudex,
I loved you once. Now you're my ex.
</pre>

<h2>Hello enzalutamide 7/2/23 </h2>
<a name="PSA11.4"></a>

<p> From worse to much worse still: my PSA has jumped to 11.4 and the
scan showed multiple tumours in lymph nodes and bone. Rather nasty to
say the least. Maybe the bicalutamide was actually still doing some good
after all. I've been prescribed enzalutamide, a significantly stronger
hormonal treatment. The side-effects are also stronger, fatigue being
the main one.  I've been put on half the normal dose for now.  My cancer
has generally been quite sensitive to hormonal treatments, so a half
dose might be effective and it should reduce the side-effects. I'm
hoping any fatigue doesn't impact too much on my ability to cycle, my
mental health and general quality of life.
</p>

<p>
I have been stressing about this appointment more than usual and
suspected the results of the scan would not been good. But the PSA rise
comes as a shock. I was hoping it might have even decreased due to
bicalutamide withdrawal. I've been physically in good shape recently,
even riding with my fast friends again a bit and keeping up with some of
them at least. Several of us spent a few days in Adelaide for the Tour
Downunder - great riding and great vegan lunches at the market (I had
been missing the freshly made dessert tofu since I was last there, three
years ago).
</p>

<p> Before this latest result and new medication, I signed
up again for the Peter Mac fund-raising ride. I chose to ride
500km over 10 days, which didn't seem like much of a challenge,
but it might end up harder than I expected. Please donate
via <a href="https://my.ridetofightcancer.org.au/lee-naish">

treatments and cures for cancer - your help will be greatly appreciated
by many.
</p>

<h2>Hello side-effects, but at least it works! 8/3/23 </h2>
<a name="PSA1.5"></a>

<p> I saw my oncologist yesterday afternoon and he was happy to announce
my PSA had fallen to 1.5 - so happy he fetched the more senior oncologist
who was the first to see me over nine years ago. His cheery presence is
always a delight. Before the appointment I was stressed and exhausted
but being told of the drop in PSA and knowing the oncologists were
pleased with the result and not contemplating an increase in the dose
was a great relief.
</p>

<p> The afternoon of day one of taking enzalutamide I could feel my energy
slowly drain away and fatigue take over. I felt slightly better after
some bed rest but the thought of continually suffering from significant
fatigue filled me with dread. The next morning I did a 30km ride and felt
better in the afternoon. On day three I felt worse and actually slept a
bit in the afternoon. On day four I decided to see how I would cope with a
longer ride.  Initially I felt some fatigue but I was fortunate enough to
find a few cyclists I could draft behind and the pace gradually increased
up to the 50km mark, when my fatigue had evaporated. I kept going for
another 50km then had a tail wind for most of the return trip - 200+km
all up at 30+kph, a good speed for me, and I felt fine the next day. I've
done other hard rides since, including a long hilly ride with some of
my fast friends and have maintained my fitness but it's been hard work.
</p>

<p> Most days I've I've either done a long ride or done a bit over 10km in
the morning to help reduce fatigue. On days when I've not been able to do
that, the fatigue typically creeps in during the afternoon and lasts until
the next day, making riding tough.  Yesterday morning was a good example.
Before lunch and the oncologist appointment I did a hilly 100km ride,
typical of the many rides I do but it felt <strong>super</strong>
hard because I was fatigued, having missing my morning ride the day
before. Today I tried an extra short hard ride but that didn't prevent
fatigue later, so I'll keep experimenting with starategies.  I'm hoping
I can remain on top of things and managing the fatigue becomes easier.
Fortunately the fatigue doesn't feel as unpleasant as the fatigue that
comes with CFS/ME and so far I've felt better after sleeping (sometimes
with CFS/ME I feel worse, which is not uncommon) and there has been no
"pay back" fatigue from overdoing things. My daughter is now back from
overseas, though has been isolating from us the last few days in case she
recently picked up COVID (there are minimal restrictions or precautions
nowadays) and soon we will return to the new normal, whatever that may
be like. Fingers crossed.
</p>

<h2>Some much-needed good news! 10/5/23 </h2>
<a name="PSA0.1"></a>

<p> Yesterday I was told my PSA had dropped to less than 0.1 - the lowest
it has been since the early days of treatment!  I needed something to
cheer me up. I've been rather depressed recently. On my most recent
attempt at a reasonably flat 200km ride I turned back after 75km.
My body could have gone on but I just felt absolutely awful.  The fatigue
comes and goes a bit - maybe it has settled down somewhat but winter
has hit. I also had a nasty bike accident soon after my previous blog
entry. It was close to home and caused by a combination of speed, poorly
designed road infrastructure and fatigue (I had going out to try to get
over some fatigue). I had concussion, a couple of cuts on my face that
required quite a few stitches, lots of abrasions and some dental damage
but no broken bones. Fortunately there was an ambulance close by and I
had a night at the local hospital. At one point in the evening I decided
I wanted to sit up and have my back rubbed by my partner. My body had
other ideas - my already low heart rate suddenly dropped further, the
nurse hit the panic button and suddenly there were doctors and nurses
everywhere and I was rushed to the resuscitation room. Some time in the
middle of the night I was given another scan but in the morning I was
discharged. Recovery was rather slow, with lots of bruising, a large
haematoma on my hip (I fashioned a compression strap out of an old bike
tube to help but a little still remains) and some abrasions blistering
after six weeks and refusing to heal until I used antibiotic ointment (I
noticed later that by blood tests show a low neutrophil count, which may
be partly to blame for my body not being great at fighting infections).
My fitness has dropped and I've not been doing my regular push ups and
chin ups (maybe its then end for them, though I've thought that several
times before) but I'm still in pretty good shape.

<h2>Ten years!  8/12/23 </h2>

<p> I feel I should have something more profound to say, ten years
after diagnosis, but I don't have the inspiration currently.  My last
two PSA readings have remained the same - almost undetectable. The
enzalutamide is expensive (close to $100 per day for the half dose I'm
on) but it certainly does the job. I decided to take anti-depressants
over winter. They helped with my mood but not my energy levels, and made
be feel rather groggy each morning. I managed to regain a fair bit of
fitness despite the fatigue coming and going and started to wean myself
off the anti-depressants in October. In early November my fitness was
pretty good and after taking a few days off riding due to lack of energy
and poor weather there was a day with a forecast of light winds, no rain
and pleasant temperature. I took the opportunity to have my first day
without anti-depressants and tick off my annual 300km ride - a tour of
the Mornington Peninsula without and major climbs (see pic below from Pt.
Nepean, almost 200km in).  The wind turned out worse than expected and I
probably should have had an earlier coffee stop (caffeine seems to help
with the fatigue related to enzalutamide) but I made it home before the
sun set.

I had several (much needed)
rest days before my next 100+km ride and felt quite energetic on a 50
km ride a couple of days later, having had some coffee before the ride.
However, since then I've been struck down with awful fatigue.  I tried my
usual strategy of rest then exercise but to no avail.  Eventually, I saw
my GP who ordered the typical blood tests.  I expected it to be a total
waste of time, as it nearly always is, but it showed I had low vitamin B12
levels so yesterday my GP prescibed a B12 injection. Unfortunately there
is a world-wide shortage of one of the ingredients so after considerable
stuffing around I've started taking a B12 spray.  I've lost a lot of
fitness again and some mornings I wondered how I ever managed to ride
100km, let alone 300km.  However, I felt slightly more awake last night,
so hopefully the B12 will do the trick and I'll be back to solid rides
again soon.
