<h2>Vaccinations, Fatigue, and the Last(???) Lockdowns 27/12/2021</h2>
<a name="PSA0.5a"></a>
<a name="PSA0.55"></a>
<a name="PSA0.72"></a>
<a name="PSA1.11"></a>

<p> I've been seeing my oncologist every six weeks (mostly via
tele-health) and my PSA has continued to be low, but follow an exponential
growth pattern: 0.5, 0.55, 0.72, 1.11. I've not changed medication but on
my latest visit it was decided another scan was warranted. It's possible
there is a small tumour that is responsible for the PSA rise and can be
treated with radiation. I'll know more next month. The prospect of the
next stage of treatment is confronting but I'm assured there are many
more options available and I have lived with generally excellent health
over eight years since being diagnosed - far longer than expected at
the time.  </p>

<p> I had intended to write blog entries to chart all my health news in a
timely fashion but I guess I have been a little depressed over the last
six months. Melbourne had it's fifth lockdown, soon followed by it's
sixth, making it the most locked down city in the world. Vaccines for
Covid eventually became widely available and now over 90% of Australians
over the age of 15 have been vaccinated. There is still a small but
vocal group of anti-vaccination people, including ex-friends of ours,
and some people are reluctant for a variety of reasons (some of them
questionable).  For me there was never any question of whether to get
vaccinated - it is clearly the right thing to do in order to minimize
the suffering caused by this virus. It was also in my interest - before
vaccines became available the death rate due to Covid for those with
cancer was one in thirty.
</p>

<p> Unfortunately, I didn't tolerate the vaccines well. They caused
a resurgence of my CFS/ME. After each vaccination (I've had three so
far) it has taken around a month to fully recover. The first two were
particularly hard work. The way to get over fatigue, in my experience,
is exercise. You have to force your body to exercise even when it
screams for rest, but too much exercise makes things worse. After many
decades of practice I think I am reasonably good, though not perfect,
at this balancing act. The figure below shows the times and estimated
average power for riding laps near my home on June 22nd. At first it
was my slowest lap ever and around a quarter of my best power output for
that loop, despite pushing my body hard. As the ride progressed my body
performed better and my power output doubled. The next day it was
better still.
</p>

<p> With fatigue and lockdowns it has been a challenge maintaining my
health and fitness. To avoid bouts of more severe depression during
lockdowns I found I needed to ride around 30km every day but long rides
were impossible so my fitness gradually declined. With higher vaccination
rates, and the difficulty containing the Delta variant of Covid, and now
the Omicron variant, restrictions have eased and we are told there will be
no more lockdowns. I'm not entirely confident in this assertion. Over the
course of this pandemic, many millions of people have been told by their
political leaders (particularly from the conservative end of politics)
there will be no (more) lockdowns, only to be locked down when case
numbers surge and the health system looks likely to be overwhelmed.
My family has remained Covid-free, though there have been a couple of
times when one of us has isolated due to possible exposure, including on
Christmas day. We have been quite conservative with taking advantage of
eased restrictions. I regained some fitness, mostly with solo rides, and
ticked off my annual 300km ride (with a friend again this year). It was
more of a struggle than I had hoped - I think I had not fully recovered
from my third vaccination. Otherwise my health is pretty good and my
specialist GP was happy to make our appointments yearly instead of every
six months.

<h2>Seeing the enemy 16/2/2022</h2>
<a name="PSA1.79"></a>

<p>
At the end of last month I had a PET scan and saw my oncologist the next
day.  I also had PSA test results - up significantly again to 1.79, so
the cancer is definitely actively growing at a rather alarming rate.
However, the PET scan results were as good as we could have hoped for.
It showed just a single tumour, in the prostate - see the photo below
(the scan shows up several organs such as kidneys, bladder and salivary
glands; the tumour is the small spot at the bottom, just below the
bladder).
</p>

</center>

<p> Seeing the PET scan (and the jump in PSA) made me feel that death was
closer, but I also felt a bit relieved as well. Sometimes if you can see
"the enemy" it is easier to deal with than the unknown - it gives the
illusion of more control at least.  My oncologist was encouraged by
the PET scan. There are no doubt plenty of cancer cells still spread
around my body but for the most part, they are being controlled by my
medication and lack of testosterone. There is only one place where they
are growing in a uncontrolled way. The hope is the tumour can be killed
off in some way, turning back the clock somewhat in the progression of
the disease. If such a tumour had been discovered in me ten years or
more ago, before the cancer had spread, it would definitely have been
treated. Had it been found five years ago, it is doubtful it would have
been treated since it was known the cancer had spread and just killing
off a bit of it in an area that doesn't cause significant damage can do
more harm than good. However, because I have survived over eight years
in generally good health and most of the cancer is well controlled,
treating the tumour may well be worth the harm/risk. My oncologist said
he would discuss my case with other experts and refer me to a relatively
young and not so conservative radiation oncologist who may be convinced
that radiotherapy to kill the tumour is worthwhile. I have a tele-health
appointment tomorrow.  </p>

<p> I feel very lucky to have access to such expert medical care. I'm one
of the "haves", both in terms of having cancer but also wealth and access
to excellent medicine. I'm amazed by how much science and technology is
behind my care. In the basement of the Peter Mac. Cancer Center there
is a cyclotron, which accelerates charged particles to around half the
speed of light. These smash atoms apart to produce a radioactive isotope
of Florine, which is separated and combined with another carefully
constructed chemical than binds strongly to another chemical found
on the cell membrane of prostate cancer cells. I was injected with
this radioactive chemical.  It seemed slightly incongruous that it was
delivered to my room in a somewhat stained brass-covered lead container
that would not look out of place in the laboratory of an alchemist from
hundreds of years ago (the lead stops most of the radiation and the
brass prevents lead poisoning). After waiting for the chemical to circulate
through my body and bind to prostate cancer cells, I was put in the PET
scan machine. Inside my body, the Florine atoms were decaying - protons
in the nucleus were turning into neutrons plus positrons (the anti-matter
equivalent of electrons) - the alchemists were not that far off after
all! The positrons soon bump into an electron (they have opposite charges
and are thus attracted to each other) but matter and anti-matter don't
mix. Both particles are annihilated and two gamma ray photons shoot off
at the speed of light in opposite directions (yes, my body was giving
off gamma rays because anti-matter was being created within it). The
gamma rays are detected by the PET scan machine and complicated computer
algorithms are used to create a 3D image of the body showing where the
radioactive Florine has concentrated. Pretty amazing stuff! </p>

<h2>On-track for off-piste 17/2/2022</h2>

<p> My partner and I had an online chat with the radiation oncologist this
morning. There were a bunch of questions about my history (including
correcting an error in the records for when I had my orchiectomy -
a good thing I maintain this blog), symptoms and checking for things
for which radiotherapy could pose an extra risk.  The oncologists had
discussed my case (it seems like I'm a bit of a local legend as far as
defying the odds) and there was a consensus that radiotherapy was a good
option. As I mentioned in the previous post, this is orthodox for early
stages of prostate cancer but in my case the oncologist described it
as "off-piste". Few people survive metastatic prostate cancer as well
as I have so there is no data about the risks versus benefits of this
treatment for someone in my position. Two options were mentioned. One
involved inserting gold targets into the tumour then having a relatively
short but intense series of radiation treatments.  The other (preferred)
option was twenty less intense radiation treatments (five days per
week for four weeks) - rather more than I expected.  The overall dose
was discussed by the oncologists and a compromise between killing off
the tumour and side-effects was made. A higher dose would normally be
used to make sure no cancer survives but in my case there is cancer
elsewhere so total destruction of the tumour is less important.
Side-effects include tiredness and irritation of the bladder and bowel
(lasting for a few weeks) plus there is a risk of scar tissue forming
blockages and ongoing problems. During treatment I would be put on a
"low residue" diet to minimise bowel contents and allow the tumour to
be targeted with less bowel damage. It is rather scary and I do have
some dread of each new step along the path but I said to go ahead. I
am hopeful the treatment will go smoothly and turn the clock back a
bit with the progression of the disease while maintaining the existing
armoury of treatment options. So, in around a week I will be measured
up, the radiation oncologist will design the course of treatment and a
couple of weeks later I'll start the radiotherapy.  </p>

<h2>A new lease of life? 31/5/22</h2>
<a name="PSA2.43"></a>
<a name="PSA0.37a"></a>

<p> My course of radiotherapy went reasonably smoothly. It was slightly
stressful due to the requirement that my bowels should be as empty as
possible but my bladder should be full, but not too full.  Five days
a week I would jump on my bike, ride to the hospital, check in, change
into a gown and when called in I would be positioned on the machine (on
my first "measure up" visit I was given four small tattoos so I could be
lined up accurately) and the zapping would commence (assuming bowel and
bladder constraints were met). In the best case I would be back home within
an hour. Living close to a good cancer hospital has benefits. I was rather
concerned about side-effects.  I pushed myself to ride a bit more before
the treatment. Towards the end I didn't feel great, there were a few
urgent trips to the toilet, there were a few days I was extra tired and
I'm still getting up to urinate during the night with slightly annoying
frequency. However, I still managed a 100km ride every week.  </p>

<p> I had a phone consultation with the radiation oncologist soon after
treatment to check on side-effects and a week or so ago we had a face
to face meeting (around six weeks after the treatment). Just before the
treatment I had another PSA test - it had risen significantly again,
to 2.43. Since treatment it has fallen to 0.37. Around a year ago I had
the same PSA reading. It was rather a shock and signalled the start of
the distressing rise. This time it should continue to head in the other
direction because the peak effectiveness of radiotherapy can be a year or
even more after treatment, as the damaged DNA of the cancer cells leads
to further cell death. My radiation oncologist mentioned the possibility
that my PSA would drop low enough that I may be able to stop taking my
current medication. He then backtracked a bit, saying we should not get
ahead of ourselved and we should take things one step at a time. I took
it as a very positive sign anyway.  At least the oncologists seem very
happy and hopeful about my medium term prospects whereas a year ago they
were apologetic. I've also been feeling a bit more healthy recently. Its
possibly just in my head (though my mental health is still a bit fragile)
but I was told the tumour was around the size of a golf ball and given
that it was also growing rapidly it may have affected my general health
noticibly. Overall, I'm very happy to have had the radiotherapy and am
hopeful it will extend my life significantly.  </p>

<p> I can't finish this blog entry without mentioning two other things -
one negative and one positive. The first is the brutal invasion of the
Ukraine by Putin's Russia. The expectation of many was it would be a
quick war, with the might of the Russian military. However, with over
three months of fighting, bombardments etc the Russian gains are modest
but the suffering is immense. Civilians have been targetted, cluster
bombs used and mines left by retreating Russian soldiers (both cluster
bombs and mines are illegal under international law). The West, including
Australia, have provided military and humanitarian support but avoided
direct intervention. It is hard to know whats best to do to avoid and
react to such behaviour. I feel rather powerless, though I have donated
more to MSF. The positive note is the outcome of the recent Australian
federal election. The Liberal Party, leaders of the government for almost
a decade, have had a resounding defeat. I have little but contempt for
several of their senior members, including the ex-Prime Minister. Years
of federal government inaction of climate change (and most other things
for that matter) should now come to an end. For the first time I donated
money to help an election campaign - Climate 200 raised money to help
independent candidates campaign against conservatives in several key
contests. They were remarkably successful, though the ideal outcome
where MPs who support strong climate action held the balance of power
has not been achieved. Still, I welcome the change in government.  </p>
