<h1>My battle with prostate cancer</h1>

<p>
<a href="./first.html">
Back to start, December 2013</a>
</p>


<h2>Still going strong, 4/3/2015</h2>

<p> Since my last update the anniversary of my diagnosis has passed, the
calendar year ended, I had another birthday, summer has come and gone
(with its apricots and nectarines) another university teaching year
has started (not that it affects me much) and I have just had another
specialist appointment.  I've not been too sick to write a blog, just
occupied with better things.
</p>

<p> Getting over the bike accident has taken a while and my upper body
strength is still a bit less than before the accident.  I've done a bit
more climbing.  The harder climbs seem harder than they once were, partly
because I seem to have lost some climbing technique - I feel a bit like a
beginner again.  In December I started getting a salty taste in my mouth
(a cancer side-effect) which I have had intermittently.  I also developed
very sore feet, and this has persisted.  I've recently had some vitamin
B12 injections, though its not clear they have helped.  The problems
started around the time I was seeing the exercise physiologist, who said
my jogging technique was wrong and should be changed.  Maybe that did
some damage which is taking a while to heal.  </p>

<p> On a more positive note, in January I bought myself a second hand
road bike.  I was a bit surprised how different it felt compared with
my old hybrid, and it took some getting used to.  But now my old bike
seems <strong>so</strong> slow and heavy.  I rode about 3000km last year.
So far this year I have ridden around 260km on my old bike and almost
1000km on the road bike.  On Monday I morning I rode to Mentone and back.
Riding down the Bay trail on a cool sunny morning with minimal wind
was a treat.  From Mentone back to St Kilda I went along Beach Rd and
averaged 33km/h.  There wasn't much traffic and it was a lot of fun.
In the afternoon I went to the gym for an upper body workout.  I think
I can declare myself reasonably fit!  So I was reasonably hopeful as I
went off to see the specialist, but there was the lurking fear that my
PSA level had started to rise.  Its been significantly more than a year
on hormone therapy so its likely to happen soon.  Fortunately not yet -
its still 0.1, which is great news.  </p>

<a name="PSA0.1"></a>
<h2>Getting boring for readers, 10/6/2015</h2>

<p> Boring perhaps, but good for me - my PSA level is still 0.1.
Apparently there is a big variation in how long it takes for PSA levels
to start rising.  Hopefully I will be at the good end of the spectrum.
I'm still fit and in good spirits, though my blood pressure is a bit
variable and I quite often get very tired.  Its getting a bit cold and
damp for cycling and rock climbing, though I have done 50km today and
close to 3000 or the year so far, including some nice long but slow rides
with the Moreland BUG.  My bike chain should have been replaced quite a
while ago but this afternoon there was a knock on the door and a parcel
arrived containing a new chain and various other bike bits, so I have
some maintenance to attend to.  I have been thinking of enrolling for
Amy's Gran Fondo in September.  Its a 110km timed ride in which the top
riders (not me) qualify for the world amateur championships in 2016, so
its reasonably serious.  Zooming along the Great Ocean Road with a bunch
of cyclists does have its appeal, though I'm not so sure about keeping up
with everyone and battling the hills that follow could rather punishing.
</p>

<p> My research has been progressing, with a couple of papers submitted,
and a new one started.  Juggling research, keeping fit and everything
else is a bit of a challenge.  It would be nice to have more time when
I'm not too tired.  I do spend too much time watching not so good
television in the evening, and not enough time listening to live music.
Maybe I can make more of an effort to change that.
</p>

<h2>The pain, the pain - why oh why? 24/8/2015</h2>
<a href="./macedonbike_s.jpg"> <img src="./macedonbike_th.jpg"
alt="Mt. Macedon memorial cross with 2 cyclists"></a>

<p> No, I'm not dead yet, or turned religious.  Serious road cyclists
will understand how close I have come though.  Saturday started as a
supposedly "easy ride" with a friend but turned into a 160km ride to the
memorial cross on the summit of Mt. Macedon and back.  They don't call him
"death march" Frank for nothing!  I'm not complaining - I could always
have said "no" and, knowing Frank, I was prepared for something not as
easy as advertised.  After 70km cycling mostly up hill with a head wind,
the real climb starts.  It looks like a gentle enough slope at first,
but your legs demand almost the lowest gear you have.  And you can see
the dramatic increase in gradient ahead.  Sitting at the Mt. Macedon
cafe/general store its so easy to scoff at the struggling cyclists you
see before or after you have done a day of rock climbing.  Now I know
what its like to ride up that hill.  And the climb goes on past the
general store.  And on, and on.  A slightly lower gradient at first, but
towards the bend in the road it ramps up, and around the bend its 13%.
After the toughest section something broke.  I think the weakest link
was my mind rather than my legs, but both were close to their limits.
I admit I had a bit of a rest.  Frank waited at the Camels Hump car
park and managed to convince me to carry on up to the memorial cross
rather than turn back.  That part is easier and you get the photo and a
greater feeling of accomplishment at the end.  There is no choice but
to turn back, though the view of Melbourne so far off in the distance
is intimidating - you know you are only half way.
</p>

<p> We descended the far side of the mountain. Frank said it was the
safer route but it sounded very much like an excuse to make the ride
more "interesting".  It did lead to the highlight of the day though:
zooming along Kerrie Valley Rd. and Mount Eliza Rd.  No traffic, a good
road surface and nearly all down hill.  Confidently zooming along at
70km/h is a lot of fun.  When we got back to Essendon our average speed
for the return journey was 30km/h, though it had dropped a bit lower
by the time we got home, just before the sun set.  I had previously
done only three rides over 100km, the last one just three days before,
so this was by far the toughest.  I did register for Amy's Gran Fondo
and it seems like I'm up to the challenge.
</p>

<p> Was the pain and suffering worth it?  I guess so, though I can't
say I'm looking forward to the next big hill and would be happy to stick
with less "bumpy" rides in the future.  Road cyclists to tend to go on
about the awesome climbs they have done.  I wonder if they actually do
enjoy it or its driven by ego.  Exercise should be good for my immune
system, particularly the natural killer cells that are attacking some of
my prostate cancer, according to my very vague understanding at least.
But keeping fit does take time and not all of it is fun by any means.
</p>

<p> What else has been going on, I hear you say.  I've had a couple
of papers accepted.  One on spectral debugging and another on my
new Pawns programming language.  Due to continued encouragement
(aka nagging) by the journal I have released to source code for
the implementation (perhaps somewhat prematurely) and created a <a
href="https://lee-naish.github.io/src/pawns/index.html"> home page</a> for
the language.  It even has a neat logo, so it must be good!  And there
is another mostly written new paper, plus my paper on set similarity
I should really get back to.  My partner was in a play and got a nice
mention in a review, despite her smallish role.  And my daughter is in
the finals for a French poetry competition and debating, amongst other
things.  The broad beans are growing, the blossom has started and the
possums have not yet attacked the fragolino grape (fingers crossed).
I'm getting used to living like this.  Long may it last.

<h2>Reality check 17/9/2015</h2>

<p>
Last Sunday was Amy's Gran Fondo.  Five of us rented a house in Lorne
for the weekend and Frank gave me a lift down on Friday afternoon.  It
was perfect weather - the first taste of the warmth to come.  On
Saturday the others rode to Wye River for breakfast.  I had prepared
my breakfast but I joined them for a coffee.  A beautiful 18km ride
along the Great Ocean Road on a cool sunny morning.  Its a shame the
coffee at the end was not so inspiring.  Lorne was flooded with
cyclists of course - almost 6000 had registered for the various
categories of rides.  The start on Sunday was not too early - we had
to be in position at 8:15 and rolled out a bit after 8:30.  I didn't
push myself too hard, but with so many other cyclists and going at a
decent pace I was concentrating on the riding a bit more than the views.
The first and longest climb was not too bad for me.  I passed one
person who had suffered a heart attack and was receiving CPR, which
was rather concerning but I later heard he was ok.
</p>

<p> I stopped at the aid station at the top to fill a water bottle and
grabbed a couple of protein bars.  If you want a good time you don't stop
at all and ride with a fast bunch, letting others do most of the work.
I also stopped later to let someone use my bike pump.  Frank stopped due
to a mechanical problem which caused him to miss out on qualifying for
the world championships by just a few minutes - what can you say. The
only failure I had was the battery in my bike computer, which meant I
was a little unsure of where I was on the course and I didn't find out
my maximum speed.  The last climb was a bit tough but I made it to the
finish line with no problems.  My salute was not a V for victory but a
peace sign - Australia started expanding its bombing of Syria the next
day, with what seemed to me to be very little debate about the decision.
The most enjoyable part of the ride was the descent back to Lorne, though
some of the bunch riding and the views along the Great Ocean Road and
on the first climb are also great memories.

<p> On Wednesday I missed the Moreland BUG ride due to my specialist
appointment in the afternoon, but I zipped around the Capital City
Trail instead.  I've been vacillating between fatigue and having plenty
of energy.  Given my currently fitness I was less concerned about my
results this time.  My heart sank a bit when we found out that my PSA
level had risen to 0.2.  The doctor said I shouldn't worry about it -
its still very low.  If worrying about it did any good he may have
suggested it though.  Levels do fluctuate somewhat, but the news is
certainly a lot worse than its been for the last year and a half.
Maybe it is a temporary fluctuation.  Its bound to start increasing at
some stage but given my good run so far, I had high hopes it would be
delayed for a while longer.  That evening was also my last meeting as
a council member of the Proportional Representation Society, which I
have been active in for many years.  Last year I was not going to stand
for council but was persuaded at the last minute.  This time around I'm
definitely out.  Again, it had to happen at some time.
</p>

<h2>Getting tired of this fatigue! 29/11/2015</h2>

<p> I should be out climbing today, but another bout of fatigue yesterday
lead to me cancelling, which was a bit depressing.  Recently I suffered
severe fatigue for six consecutive days, spending extra time in bed for
most of them.  At the time I didn't feel too bad about it as I had no
major commitments.  But it does add up, and when it affects things such
as anniversaries and planned activities its a real pain.  Research has
consequently been progressing frustratingly slowly also. Hopefully its
just a passing annoyance and won't get worse in the near future.
</p>

<p>
And this hunger sure gives me an appetite!  I've gained some weight
recently and its hard to lose it, especially when I'm not exercising as
much as I would normally.  I'll skip breakfast tomorrow.  Not really,
but it will be delayed.  Another bunch of pathology tests, some of which
require fasting, which is not much fun.  Complain, complain, complain...
</p>

<p> On Friday I attended the "People's Climate March" with my family
and caught up with a couple of friends.  Its was the largest rally in
Melbourne for some time, and the first of what will hopefully be a large
number of big rallies leading up to the Paris summit.  It is a shame the
Paris march will not go ahead due the French government over-reacting to
the recent terrorist attacks (perhaps if there were not French elections
coming up they would have reacted in a more calm and measured way).
The Melbourne march was still just a small fraction of the size of peace
rallies I have helped organize in the past, which is a great shame.
And it seemed to be an opportunity for many groups to push their own pet
issues which are at best vaguely related to climate change.  Its also
distressing that so many of my intelligent, informed scientist friends
who know that anthropogenic climate change is an extremely important
and urgent problem do so little to reduce their own contribution to
the problem.
</p>

<p>
On a brighter note, I clocked up 6000km on the road bike.  It looks like
I'll reach my goal of 10000km reasonably soon.
</p>

<a name="PSA0.4"></a>
<h2>More bloody reality 2/12/2015</h2>

<p> I rode to Mentone and back this morning.  A nice cool morning and
I thought it would be good to get a few more km before my specialist
appointment next Wednesday, where I was very much hoping (but not very
much expecting) to find out my PSA level had reduced again, or at least
not increased.  I planned to get back close to 12:00 then go to the gym.
When I got home there was a message on the answering machine from a
doctor I see, asking me to call back.  I got my results a week earlier
than expected and they were not good - my PSA has risen again to 0.4.
My testosterone level has also gone up a bit for some unknown reason.
The only optimistic interpretation of the results that I can think of
is that the increased testosterone has lead to the higher PSA and if my
testosterone can be inhibited further the cancer will get less active
again.  A more realistic interpretation is that I have a significant
quantity of castrate resistant prostate cancer cells and the number is
doubling every three months or so.
</p>

<p>
I still went to the gym, but after making a couple of phone calls.
Telling my daughter when she gets home from school will be a bit tough.
</p>

<h2>Don't Panic! 11/12/2015</h2>

<p> On Sunday the family plus a couple of friends went climbing at
Camels Hump.  A pretty relaxing day for all concerned, but I did check
out a grade 18 called Poxbow I was thinking of trying to lead.  At the
gym early this year we were encouraged to set some goals.  One of mine
was doing a 150km bike ride and another was leading a grade 18 climb.
</p>

<p> On Wednesday I missed the Moreland BUG ride due to my specialist
appointment, but in the morning I went for a 70km ride independently and
caught up with them briefly.  The specialist didn't seem overly concerned
about my results.  The previous PSA reading was 0.29 rather than 0.2 as
I was told.  It seems doctors tend to truncate results rather than round
them.  Or perhaps they understate bad news.  An increase from 0.29 to 0.4
gives a significantly longer doubling time, so I was somewhat relieved.
Mind you, if you compute doubling time using the previous 0.1 result it
makes no difference.  But maybe the previous reading was 0.19 and that
was truncated also.  Its easy to over-analyse PSA levels.  I was told
a doubling time of less than three months was considered "high risk"
(whatever that means in this context) and greater than six months is
(relatively) good.  My testosterone level should be at most 0.5 but it is
0.8, so I'll change to a different ADT medication and we will see if that
works better.  Hopefully it will, but I am now considered to be in the
"rising PSA" category - the next stage on the journey.  However, I felt
somewhat better after seeing the specialist.  No need to panic just yet.
There are also some new medications they might also try out on me before
chemotherapy, so it looks like I might keep my hair for a while longer
(not that it matters much to me).
</p>

<p> On Thursday I returned with a friend to Camels Hump.  Perfect weather
and we had the cliff to ourselves for much of the day. I lead Poxbow
quite easily, with minimal stress.  Leading does seem a bit more scary
than it once did though.  I did a few laps plus struggled to get up a
couple of grade 21 climbs on top rope - I managed to get up, but with
some help.  My fingers/forearms need a bit more strength it seems.
If you add up all the grades of the climbs I did it was 2*9 + 3*18 +
3*21 = 135, which is way more climbing than I have done in a day for a
very long time.  And our traditional post-climbing pizza at La Taverna
was extremely enjoyable.  A great day!
</p>

<h2>Another tick 17/12/2015</h2>

<p>
I went on the regular Moreland BUG ride yesterday, to Craigieburn.  Not
the nicest ride I've done (a bit warm and dry, I was a bit low on energy and
the planned side trip to the Merri Creek gorge was cancelled because the
path was closed).  But my daughter came along, which made up for it.  It
was her longest ride to date (around 66km) and on the way I clocked up
10000km since diagnosis.
</p>

<h2>Another year, and a bit 31/1/2016</h2>

<p> In 2015 I signed in at the gym 176 times, rode 7217km, had two papers
published, submitted another and released the first versions of the Pawns
compiler.  A pretty good effort I think.  On Jan 10 it was the anniversary
of buying my road bike and I rode about 140km to Mornington and back to
clock up 7000km.  If you want to ride more, buy a road bike!  A few days
ago I went climbing for an afternoon at Werribee Gorge and successfully
climbed Snatch and Grab, a familiar grade 21, and did three other climbs
for the first time, including a new grade 23 (which I had to rest on a
couple of times).  So my body is performing well, though its hard work to
maintain my strength etc.  My mental capacity is definitely reduced and
my memory seems rather poor now.  I finally have a complete version of my
<a href="../papers/ssm/index.html">paper on set similarity</a>, which I will submit
to a journal shortly, but wonder how many more papers I will publish.
</p>

<p> I think one of the most important events of 2015 was the Paris climate
change summit.  I feel I contributed a little to it at least, with some
clicktivism, a few attendances at rallies and financial support for the
<a href="http://www.climatecouncil.org.au/"> Climate Council</a>.  As well
as supporting such things I think its important we take responsibility for
our contribution to global warming and change our behaviour to reduce it.
Its very hard to calculate my own carbon footprint but for several years
our household electricity consumption has been less than what we produce
with our small 1kW photo-voltaic array.  I paid for a larger PVA
on a rental property, have plans for another and have also contributed
significantly to the cost of a large PVA planned for my daughter's school
- maybe this year they will reach their fundraising target and actually
build it!  I'm pretty sure cycling was my primary form of transport in
2015, but we do use a bit of natural gas and everything else adds up (such
as the Italian Parmesan cheese and my share of the gym air-conditioning).
I may not be carbon-neutral, but I have way less impact than the
per-capita Australian average and probably less than the per-capita
Chinese average.  However, I think the fact that China manufactures so
many goods which are consumed in places such as Australia means some of
the Chinese emissions should be attributed to their trading partners.
Here I am blogging about accounting - it must be time to stop!
</p>

<h2>The toughest battle:-) 12/2/2016</h2>

<p> There is no doubt I'm facing my toughest battle.  Am I prepared?
Not really - thats one reason why its so hard.  When faced with
something like this it natural to feel "if only I could have a bit
more time", but I don't have that luxury.  There will be pain,
for sure.  Lots of it.  And it will go on and on.  But it will
eventually stop.  Its great to get support from friends and loved
ones, telling me to be strong and keep fighting, but in the end its
my body and my struggle.  On a scale of difficulty with one being the
most difficult, its even harder than that - its beyond classification.
Yes, death march Frank has struck again and persuaded me to attempt a <a
href="http://theclimbingcyclist.com/climbs/baw-baw-national-park/mt-baw-baw/">
ride up Mt. Baw Baw</a>, tomorrow!  If you hear nothing more from me
I have probably had a heart attack.  At least I will have ended with
some humour.
</p>

<h2>Still pushing 13/2/2016</h2>

<p> Maybe I should apologise for that last post - I have now added a
smiley at least.  I was expecting to stretch my physical and particularly
mental endurance but it turned out to be not so hard for me after all.
I guess the lesson of the day is that, for some battles at least, its best
not to tackle things head on and just rely on grit and determination.
If you pace yourself, think strategically, follow the strategy and
take things one step at a time you can achieve more than you expect.
By taking it easy on the less steep bits and zig-zagging quite a lot
on the steeper bits (taking full advantage of the lack of non-cycling
traffic) I conquered what many think is the hardest road cycling climb
in Australia, without getting off the bike to rest or even feeling I
was approaching my limits.  Not a great time by any means - the last 6km
took me an hour (mind you, it has an average gradient of more than 10%).
It was 70km of cycling in all, with almost 1900 vertical metres of
climbing.  I certainly appreciate climbing (on a bike) a lot more now.
</p>

<h2>Please consider sponsoring me 25/2/2016</h2>

<p>
My gym is involved in a fundraising project for the RMH, involving some
pedaling.  Sounds right up my alley so I signed up.  Please
<a href="https://ridetorecovery-12hourchallenge.everydayhero.com/au/lee">
check it out and/or donate</a>.
</p>

<h2>Still trying to change the world 7/3/2016</h2>

<p> Although I'm no longer on the council of the Proportional
Representation Society there has been a recent flurry of
activity surrounding a new Senate electoral system and I put in <a
href="http://www.aph.gov.au/DocumentStore.ashx?id=a72f42e7-0b9f-4158-aa52-2da3c23c797d">
a submission to the JSCEM</a>.  One of the most outrageous aspects
of the Bill has been amended but the process has been so rushed that
the more subtle things such as the impact on the way votes should be
counted seem to have been overlooked.  Not an ideal way to run a country.
<a href="https://lee-naish.github.io/papers/adtpp/index.html">The paper
I submitted just before Christmas</a> has been accepted subject to a
few minor revisions - a good way to wrap up a little project which has
been going for some years.  The solar panels have been installed at
the school, so perhaps my greenhouse footprint is now zero or better.
On Saturday it was far from it though. We drove to Merrijig and <a
href="http://theclimbingcyclist.com/climbs/alpine-national-park/mt-buller/">
rode up Mt. Buller</a> and back then drove home.  It was a nice ride.
Reasonably tough towards the end, and the extra 1km beyond the village
was really tough.  But I made it (with no zig-zagging this time) and
the descent was exhilarating.  The heat, head wind and tiredness as we
approached Merrijig made us very glad we hadn't set out from Mansfield
instead!  </p>

<p> I had my regular PSA and testosterone tests taken last week and will
see a specialist in a couple of days to get the results.  I've not been
called by my other GP with bad news this time.  Not yet at least.  I try
not to worry at all, but its difficult.  Are the cramping muscles in my
thighs last week a sign of the prostate cancer returning, or are they
just due to not eating enough on the ride up Mt. Ridley on Monday, or the
exercise bike training I did on Tuesday to prepare for the fund-raising?
Are the pains in my chest a sign of the bone metastases or is it just
from over-doing the chest press at the gym?  Hopefully the news will
good on Wednesday and I can relax some more.  Mind you, I'm not even
sure what a good result is at this stage.  It seems unlikely that my
PSA will not have risen at all and I don't want to wish for things that
are unrealistic.  Maybe its best to have no expectations and prepare to
be detached if the news is bad.  </p>

<a name="PSA0.3"></a>
<h2>What goes up can come down! 9/3/2016</h2>

<p> At least my PSA level can.  It has dropped from 0.4 to 0.3, which
is a great relief (counting from the last reading of 0.1, that makes
a doubling time of around 5.7 months according to my calculations).
And my testosterone has dropped to below 0.5 so the new medication is
working better.  Mind you, it has its down side also.  Its not a normal
injection and when I went to my GP he offered me a local anaesthetic,
which I bravely declined.  Then I saw the size of the needle!  Its an
implant rather than a liquid or gel, so its like getting a skewer rammed
into your guts.  At least I now know its worth it.
</p>

<h2>More ups and downs 4/6/2016</h2>

<p>
It seems I'm in the habit of updating the blog just before my specialist
appointment.  Its potentially more positive that way.  Mostly I've been
feeling good and I can express that now, but if the news is bad on
Wednesday it will be harder to look on the bright side.  I did get
rather depressed a while back.  It started with a period of fatigue,
which I still suffer from occasionally, then I felt like shit.  After a
couple of weeks of struggling to maintain a healthy degree of exercise,
sunshine etc I started to shake it off.
</p>

<a name="meetup"></a>

<p> I somewhat reluctantly joined meetup.com a while back,
initially because I volunteered to give a talk about my <a
href="https://lee-naish.github.io/src/pawns/index.html">Pawns</a>
programming language to a group, but I later joined the Melbourne Cycling
group as well.  Its a great use of the internet but I have reservations
about the privacy aspects.  It should be possible to have the benefits of
getting in touch with like-minded people without our personal information
being owned by a corporation.  Perhaps its on the "to do" list of the <a
href="http://www.eff.org">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>.  I've done
four rides with the group, all in the last month.  An initial easy one,
mostly on suburban bike paths, and three great harder rides.  They all
involved over 100km of cycling at 25-30+km/h on flat sections, plus climbs
of varying length and intensity.  Highlights have included the croissants
at the Kinglake Bakery, the descents from Kinglake and into Yarra Glen,
averaging over 33km/h from Frankston to Safety Beach then sticking on
someone's wheel at up to 43km/h on the flat to finally catch up with
the bunch at Rye, and the views from Point Nepean.  After the (135km)
Point Nepean ride on Wednesday I did an 80km "recovery" ride on Thursday
to Hurstbridge and surrounds and did 40km on Friday to round things off.
It must be over 300km for the week and a record for me.  Despite the fact
that winter has officially started, we have been having typical Melbourne
autumn weather (until today) and I have been making the most of it!
</p>

<p>
Its a bit of a distraction from writing and revising papers but I've been
doing a bit of that too.  One has been published, another I'm revising,
another we have submitted to a journal, another we are extending and plan
to submit to a journal and another short one I thought had been forgotten
about looks like it will appear soon also.  And thats not counting one
(possibly two) that may appear in a local informal functional
programming conference/unconference later this year.
</p>

<p>
I'm not looking forward to the rest of winter.  The lounge room is
already about 10 degrees.  Soon we will be putting on the heater.  And
although we have used the sun for all our hot water so far this
year, soon we will contributing to global warming on some days when we

<h2>Deja vu 8/6/2016</h2>

<p> My PSA level has risen, as expected, but only to 0.4 (the same as
six months ago).  Its been suggested I stop seeing a urologist every
three months as they just tell me my latest PSA level, request another
PSA test, write a prescription for my medication and tell me to carry on.
I had wondered if it was worthwhile.  However, it was suggested I see a
medical oncologist to discuss the possibility of having some pro-active
chemotherapy, since the latest research indicates having chemotherapy
early improves life expectancy.  So I have an appointment booked for
three weeks time, and before that I'll have another CT scan to see if
there are any visible signs of cancer left.  Its not likely there are
any (though I still have cancer, of course) but if there are, its more
likely chemotherapy will be recommended.
</p>


<h2>Audacious! 27/6/2016</h2>

<p> I did my first Audax ride yesterday - the Wandong Winter Wander.
It started and finished in Wandong and was quite a wander, at 205km (my
longest ride to date).  It was also rather wintery - the temperature
was minus three degrees at one point and the average for the day was
three. For almost half the ride my bike computer failed to work because
it was too cold.  There was also fog for the first couple of hours and
perhaps a minute of sunshine for the whole day.  Fortunately I bought
myself a new warm wind-proof jersey for the ride and borrowed an extra
layer for by feet and hands (the outer gloves developed a layer of
frost as we rode though the fog).  Despite everything, I was reasonably
comfortable and although being rather slow on the climbs I averaged
over 27km/h.  I really appreciated the people I was riding with keeping
the pace comfortable for me, and the Audax people who organised the ride.
It can't be much fun for a volunteer waiting alone in the cold for hours
so they can provide a hot drink, delicious minestrone and other goodies
for riders as they arrive, and stamp their passports etc.  Hats off to
them!  And it was great to see re-usable cups and bowls used.  It seems
like despite the state of the planet throw-away cups are everywhere.
I was anticipating either missing out on a cuppa or fishing one out
of a rubbish bin.  I'm not sure how many more Audax rides I'll go on,
if any, but they seem to be a great bunch of people and I'm very glad
I did this ride.  I'll get my official stamped passport and badge once
the paperwork has been done in France!  </p>


<h2>No chemotherapy for now 30/6/2016</h2>

<p> I saw the medical oncologist (and a urologist) yesterday.  He did not
recommend chemotherapy and suggested that if I had been given chemotherapy
earlier it would not have helped significantly.  Its seems that early
chemotherapy is most helpful for people who do not respond well to hormone
therapy and I have responded very well.  I guess that counts as a good
thing. The scan showed up various places where the cancer had spread but
has mostly died due to the hormone therapy.  There is a place in my upper
spine where it was particularly bad.  Hopefully the cancer has gone from
there and won't return, otherwise I'll most likely have radiotherapy
there at some stage. I'm also back to seeing a urologist/oncologist
every three months (in fact I'll seeing both again in three months).  </p>


<h2>The dimensions of life 13/9/2016</h2>

<p> Everyone talks about length of life and quality of life.  I'm still
desperately hoping for a major breakthrough in prostate cancer treatment
or, failing that, in dying with dignity legislation.  I want the option of
ending my life sooner if the quality is too low and I may well need some
help if and when the time comes.  But there are other dimensions to life.
</p>

<p> There is depth.  You can dip your toe in or dive headlong. Some
people live their lives with the brakes on.  If you take the brakes off
you live more deeply. There is a risk you will get hurt.  Actually,
there is certainty - if you live you <em>will</em> get hurt.  But to
live life to the fullest you must take risks and live deeply.
</p>

<p> And there is breadth.  Getting the balance right between different
aspects of life is hard but important.  Balancing work and
other aspects of life such as family is often hard.  A successful
academic must have great depth and its very hard to find enough time for
other things.  If you share your passions with the people close to you
its easier but thats often not the way things work out. To live life to
the fullest you must get the balance right and have breadth.
</p>

<p> Some of the people in the Melbourne Cycling meetup group are an
inspiration.  The inspiration for this blog entry, and the inspiration
for me living life more than I ever have before.  My life will likely be
made longer by the increased physical fitness I have achieved by
doing a hard 100+km ride group ride almost every week (assuming I don't
get wiped out by a careless driver).  My quality of life has improved
by my enjoyment of riding through the country and hearty laughter over
a well-earned lunch.  After one beautiful ride with both old and new
friends I was on a wonderful high for hours.  Perhaps it was a chemical
imbalance in my brain but whatever the reason, it was quality time.
I take some risks and reap the rewards.  Sometimes its a bit scary.
Sometimes very scary.  Sometimes there is pain.  Like colliding with
a kangaroo last Saturday when cruising down a hill at around 40km/h.
Or like saying or hearing something hurtful in a new friendship.  But all
the good feelings make it so worthwhile.  I hope I can balance things
well enough to maintain the right breadth as well.  There is the social
aspect within the cycling group, which is great, but getting the balance
right with family, other friends, academic life, gardening etc is a work
in progress.  A big thanks to everyone who helps me live and apologies
for the inevitable mistakes I make along the way!

<h2>A nice surprise 29/9/2016</h2>

<p> I had my urologist appointment yesterday.  I hadn't been thinking
too much about what my PSA level would be, distracting myself by cycling
and other things.  But it does always cause me stress.  Fortunately the
news was far better than I expected.  Happily my PSA level remains at 0.4!
</p>

<p> I also brought up the topic of orchiectomy (getting my balls chopped
off), which I had done on a few occasions before.  Early after diagnosis
I mentioned they were "at best decorative" but doctors in Australia
generally seem reluctant to give them the chop.  In other countries
such as The Netherlands it is far more common and in poor countries
it is the treatment of choice because of the cost of ADT medication.
I was a bit shocked to discover a while back that the medication I'm
currently on costs the taxpayers over $1000 per injection (around three
times the cost of the medication I was previously on).  In Australia we
are very fortunate to have the PBS, so it costs me the same as any other
prescription.  On a recent ride I decided that having an orchiectomy
was the right thing to do.  It is 100% reliable, it means Australians
pay less money to big pharmaceutical companies, it avoids a painful
injection every three months and (I joked) saves me carrying some excess
baggage up climbs.  Having made the decision with no pressure from the
urologist he agreed it was a good decision.  So I'm now on an elective
surgery waiting list.  The countdown has started for the "you don't have
the balls" jokes.
</p>

<h2>An expensive oncologist visit 22/10/2016</h2>

<p> I had a medical oncologist appointment on Wednesday.  I have been keen
to get a clearer view of my prognosis and what is likely to occur over
the next months to years.  I had heard this doctor was rather reluctant
to make predictions.  I also wanted to get an opinion on a couple
of diet-related questions.  I was somewhat relieved that he did not
encourage extreme diets and said that the phytoestrogens in soy products
were, if anything, beneficial as they tend to reduce testosterone.
Its hard to get an accurate prognosis because individual cases vary
so much.  I am doing much better than expected though. ADT typically
works for a year before the cancer becomes castrate resistant whereas
after almost three years my cancer, I was told, is not yet castrate
resistant (I thought it was <a href="#PSA0.4">almost a year ago</a>).
Apparently my recent stable PSA level is not that uncommon, so it may
not be associated with all the exercise I do, though staying fit is good
for everything. Its unclear how long my cancer will continue to respond
to ADT but I was also told that typical life expectancy after castrate
resistance is around three years.  Rather scary, but because I have
done so well until now I am likely to continue to do better than most.
When I do reach that stage I'll mostly likely go on a clinical trial
with a combination of existing and new medications.
</p>

<p> I also wanted to know what PSA level is typically associated with
a decline in general health, but it varies a lot, so no answers there
either.  Information is most important if it changes your behaviour or
the decisions you make.  Something that has been on my mind recently,
prompted by suggestions of cycling friends, is whether I should buy a
new bike.  The oncologist said yes - I think his guard slipped a bit
and he implied that me having good general health for another year
is a conservative prediction.  He also said that cycling goes well with
chemotherapy (though I expect some of the really hard rides I have done
recently would not be possible).  I find it hard to justify buying some
of the more expensive bikes friends have suggested so I think I will go
for something rather cheaper.  But it looks like I'll be buying myself
the most expensive consumer product/gift/toy of my life.  I have ridden
over 15,000km on my current bike (that cost $700 second hand) and am on
track to soon reach 20,000km since diagnosis (twice my original goal)
and ride over 10,000km this year. I reckon if I can ride another
10,000km a new bike is worthwhile.
