<h2>Bad news in a post-binary world 13/3/2019</h2>
<a name="PSA1.69"></a>

<p> Let's get the bad news out of the way: a PSA of 1.69.  I had expected
around 1.5 (based on a quick calculation before the oncologist visit
yesterday) and hoped for around 1.4, so its the worst news I've had for
quite a while. I've started taking Bicalutamide to block the
small amount of testosterone my body (and cancer) produces but declined
extra imaging as it probably would have showed nothing. My oncologist
said the PSA doubling time (the most important metric of cancer growth)
is around eight months.  It's not a good idea to use just the two most
recent data points to calculate doubling time, so I won't mention it here
but it's scary. The whole bloody thing is scary and brings home what I
we all know, but given my health to date is all too easy to sweep under
the rug.  I guess with cancer you should always be prepared for bad news,
as my oncologist is, but with over five years of relatively good news
it came as a bit of a shock.
</p>

<p> Sometimes I feel like a rabbit in a spotlight - mesmerized and unable
to move on.  More often I'm darting off at high speed, on my bike.
I pushed myself particularly hard on a 140km ride a few days
ago and concluded later it was due to fear of my imminent oncologist
appointment. I've actually been riding less recently; around 850km in
February, which is my lowest monthly total for years. Since New Year I've
felt less motivated, realising the only person who really cares about
how much I ride and what my strava stats look like is me, and also had
a bit more fatigue. I did complete the ACE 250km ride in January (and a
couple of longish rides beforehand to ensure I was in good shape for it),
but that was primarily because I had a ticket from the previous year
(due to the accident I had).  So far the extra rest days have made my
riding stronger if anything. On a recent ride through the Bass Hills I
got a Strava KOM (fastest ever for that segment), much to the surprise
of everyone on the ride (photo from the ride below).
</p>

<p> It's good to have the support of my partner, back from her overseas
trip with our daughter. I have some regrets about saying I expected a
PSA level of around 1.5.  She was taught to be pessimistic from a young
age and expected 1.6, but even that was not pessimistic enough. We try
to be strong for each other and put on a brave face. Shedding of tears
is done in private, as much as possible at least.
</p>

<p> My daughter has started her university study and a couple of her
friends who were once considered female now identify as being male. I
find it interesting how mainstream views of the world change, and how
my own views have changed.  For most of my life the binary view has
predominated. There were males and females. I was a strong advocate of
viewing computer programming from the viewpoint of classical logic, where
things are true (a correct result is computed) or false (an incorrect
result is computed): a simple, elegant and beautiful view. But even
programming is not that simple in reality. Sometimes nothing is computed
(formal mathematical systems, including computation, have their limits)
and sometimes we feed garbage into computers (how are we to judge the
correctness of the result in such cases?). I eventually concluded that
the binary view was not the best way to view the world of programming.
I've written papers on this but it is hard to persuade the advocates of
classical logic - simplicity has great appeal.
</p>

<p>
Similarly, the binary view of gender has its limitations.  With this
view, I am a male, I always have been and always will be. But it
does not help in discussing degrees of masculinity (or femininity).
Having been without testosterone for over five years I have certainly
become less masculine. The change in hormones has chemical, physical and
psychological impacts. I have found it a little confronting (perhaps less
so than many men in similar positions) but also interesting. Having lived
through this change I don't think it's just political correctness that
makes me appreciate and support the non-binary view of gender. There
are degrees of masculinity and femininity and degrees of fluidity.
Sexuality is even more complex of course.  I used to consider myself
as being close to the heterosexual end of the spectrum, but sexuality
is far from one-dimensional.  I think a better analogy is to say I'm
currently in the heterosexual low libido region of the (RGB) colour cube.
For nearly everything, it shouldn't matter where you are in the gender and
sexuality space, where you have been or what direction you are heading.
We are far from that ideal but I hope the world moves closer to it.
</p>

<p>
Addendum (14/3): having written the above I Googled the side-effects
of Bicalutamide.  One of the "very common" (&ge;10%) side-effects
is Gynecomastia.  I had to look that up to find out it means growing
breasts! The irony (or even humour) is not lost on me, but I think my
life is "interesting" enough without that. In retrospect, the oncologist
seemed a little cagey about side-effects and wanted to follow up in a
month to see how I was going - I wonder it that was the reason.
</p>

<h2>Some days things just go right 24/5/2019</h2>
<a name="PSA0.24"></a>

<p> Wednesday could not have been much better.  It was one of
those perfect Melbourne days where the autumn leaves glow in the
sunshine against the bright blue sky, with barely a breeze to
send them fluttering to the ground. I looked at my phone
over breakfast and saw that a friend had made a donation to <a
href="https://my.unitetofightcancer.org.au/lee-naish">my fund raising
page</a>, bringing the total up to my initial target. I decided some time
ago participate in the Peter Mac ride/walk to raise funds for cancer
research. Fund raising is a bit of a pain for those who do it and the
people they hassle (speaking of which, <em>please</em> donate via the
link above and share it with all your friends:) but I've not done any
for a while and the 100km mostly flat ride should be no problem for me.
And of course it does a lot of good.
</p>

<p> Next up was my specialist GP visit.  I didn't really know what to
expect, but hoped my PSA would have dropped a little at least. It
had dropped a lot!  From 1.69 to 0.24 - the level I had in <a
href="./second.html#PSA0.2">2015</a> and after my orchiectomy in 2017.
The medication I was put on after my most recent oncologist visit seems
to be working well. Research in cancer treatment is never fast enough
but clearly a lot of progress has been made and I'm happy to help it
along with fund raising and even happier to benefit from it.  My other
pathology results were ok - cholesterol a bit worse and blood pressure
was high (I get "white coat fever" and it took a while to subside a bit).
I will see an oncologist in a couple of weeks and hope he is as pleased
as I currently am.
</p>

<p> The lead up to getting my results was less stressful than on
most recent occasions as I had an important distraction - a new road
bike. Just after ordering it online a few weeks ago I felt awful pangs
of guilt and the weight of the world on my shoulders. It's more than a
little obscene that some people are able to buy such expensive toys on a
whim when others have so little. And what hope is there when an educated
and (I think) good person such as myself cannot resist the pressures of
consumerism? At least its not a sports car or a yacht I suppose.  And it
is an amazing machine! Having assembled it on Tuesday, I took it on its
first real outing on Wednesday after my GP appointment.  Road cyclists are
so lucky to have the Kew Boulevard just out of the city. Seven glorious
kilometers of twists and turns over rolling hills in the Yarra Bend park,
with great views and not a traffic light to slow you down. I smashed my
best southbound time on the first attempt with the new bike.
</p>

<p> In the afternoon I rode to La Mama Theatre in Carlton for the
production meeting for my partner's show that is coming up in early July,
<a href="https://www.trybooking.com/501619">Twigs That Never Took</a>.
I've been helping with the design and construction of the set and
publicity (speaking of which, get some friends together and come along!).
It's a much larger space than the last production and I'm looking forward
to seeing the show again. What a happy day!
</p>

<h2>Spring has sprung 12/9/2019</h2>
<a name="PSA0.17"></a>

<p> In the last couple of weeks there have been some very nice times. I
saw my oncologist on Tuesday and my PSA had dropped further, to 0.17.
Earlier it was my partner's birthday and we spent a couple of days
in and around Warburton. The last night we stayed there it snowed on
Mt. Donna Buang (see photo below; click for high resolution version) and
we did more walking than I've done for a long time. The previous Saturday
I did an extra-hard 150km ride from Warrugul through Gippsland. The
days are getting longer, the sun has more warmth and as I sit here in
the sun room I can see the blossom on our young apricot tree.  </p>

<center>
<a href="./lichen.jpg"> <img src="./lichen_th.jpg" width="80%"
alt="lichen and fungus on tree branch"></a>
</center>

<p> I often struggle a bit to remain positive during winter. The
cold, drizzle and lack of sunshine take their toll.  I've been cycling
significantly less than the last couple of years. The weather has been
poor and there have been some distractions.  Production week for my
partner's play was intense but I thought it went well. I had a flare
up of an old problem with my lower back. It was particularly bad to
I had some scans done, which revealed a couple of damaged discs, as I
had expected.  I was also a bit shocked at how much damage the cancer
had done to the bones.  But distractions and weather aside, I do feel
like I'm slowing down.  I'm not sure when I last felt energetic or strong
and it's a little reminiscent of the Chronic Fatigue Syndrome days. It's
not the cancer - the low PSA indicates it is currently controlled well.
Perhaps it is old age - I do feel like I'm getting old and although it
isn't fun, it is better than the alternative.  I think its mostly the
side-effects of having minimal testosterone.  </p>

<p> Lack of testosterone has many physical and psychological affects.
When I started taking Bicalutamide I noticed feeling less confident
and more fearful. I've adapted, but not overcome it. I recently had
an anaesthetic for a filling at the dentist and had a very unpleasant
reaction when it was wearing off - feelings of emotional pain, depression
etc, which I attribute to being not quite right due to the cancer and
side-effects of treatment.  Part of the feeling of not being strong etc is
just in my head. I know from my gym workouts that my upper body strength
has not significantly declined over the last couple of years and I'm
still riding with the same bunch of cyclists. Despite us all getting
older, at least some are riding more strongly than ever. It
feels like I'm often at the tail end of a high performance group, with
plenty of very good excuses for why I'm not better.  But those ahead of
us are always more visible than those behind. Whether it's people who
are faster at cycling or smarter or more talented or more courageous or
more beautiful or more privileged. It's helpful to be comfortable
wherever you are, to realise most attributes are not one dimensional and to
respond with admiration rather than resentment for those ahead and
support rather than scorn for those behind.
</p>

<p>
With help, I have been getting on top of various other aspects of life,
arresting the trend towards chaos.  I've bought another car, having been
without a drivable one for over six months, caught up on overdue tax
returns and made significant process in organising my finances better
plus getting some home maintenance done. So life goes on, in a pretty
positive way. 
</p>

<h2>Six years 5/12/2019</h2>
<a name="PSA0.14"></a>

<p> Today marks six years since my diagnosis. Six times around the sun
on this all too fragile planet that is our home. Six years of rising CO2
emissions, rising temperatures, melting ice, bleaching coral and burning
forests.  As I write this, the COP25 climate conference is on in Madrid.
All the science says the current trajectory is leading us to disaster and
tipping points are close. We are in a climate emergency and huge changes
are needed <strong>now</strong>.  The many promising actions occurring
are nowhere near enough.  The lack of political will in countries such as
Australia, Brazil, Japan and the USA is appalling. I feel a tinge of guilt
due to the excessive carbon footprint I had for much of my academic life,
travelling to overseas conferences most years until 2000.  But there is
little point in dwelling on the past in an emergency.  What I find more
upsetting is recent actions of the people I love, care about and respect
most. Despite being some of the most privileged people in the world,
nearly all of them are still part of the problem rather than part of the
solution. In the last couple of years their air travel alone has vastly
exceeded their carbon budget (the limit on CO2 equivalent emissions per
person required to avoid catastrophic climate change).  I feel I should
do more. Sometimes I despair.
</p>

<p> At least I'm still very much alive, despite initial predictions. On
Tuesday I had two bits of good news. First, my PSA has dropped even
further, to 0.14, and other pathology results are fine as well.  Second,
my appointment as a senior fellow has been renewed again. I'm always
conscious that my good news is not necessarily shared by everyone reading
this. I was shocked and saddened a few days ago when I heard Nat Colossimo
had passed away. I met Nat via the Peter Mac Cancer Surgery team, and
we did the Unite to Fight Cancer fund-raising ride just a month ago. I
knew treatment options for his prostate cancer were running out but did
not realise how aggressive his cancer was.  On a brighter note, another
friend with double hit lymphoma has had a stem cell transplant and
things are looking hopeful for him.
</p>

<p> I was one of the top fund-raisers for the Unite ride (raising over
$5000), but over-did it on the ride and the following days. I had been
trying to improve my strength and endurance, having been lucky enough
to get onto another bike packing ride organised by Sarah and Jesse
(one advantage of spending too much time on Facebook - it was booked
out almost as soon as it was announced). I have not been riding as much
this year, particularly over winter, and its a tough three-day ride
with lots of climbing and lots of rough tracks. On the Peter Mac ride
I was getting over a nasty cold that had put me in bed for three days.
I was at or near the front of the 100km group, working hard
for almost all the ride, and did another 30km or so as well. The next day
I did a 100+km ride with plenty of hills out to Strathewan and back (so
much nicer than riding through the SE suburbs of Melbourne) and two days
later I did another 100+km ride with a couple of climbs up Mt. Dandenong.
The next few days I started to feel quite unwell and the morning of my
next planned ride I felt too nauseous to eat. I spent a day in hospital,
was diagnosed with Meningitis and hardly ate for three days. A few days
after hospital I visited my GP and was diagnosed with shingles (the
same virus caused the Meningitis).  I was in a bad way. Lots of pain
killers, anti-nausea, anti-viral and other medication plus bed rest.
Then when I was starting to feel a bit better another three days in bed
with a nasty cold.  </p>

<p> Instead of giving up on the bike packing I decided to try to balance
the rest my body needed for recovery with some riding to retain some
strength and endurance.  It was always going to be a marginal proposition
and many advised I should give up on the ride, listen to my body and rest
rather than risk getting sick again.  But I'm stubborn.  Very stubborn,
and very keen. And I reckon listening to your body is one of the main
causes of obesity, heart disease and early death. It certainly hasn't
lead to any gold medals. In my experience these rides are tough but
very rewarding. They are great fun in themselves and they help keep me
feeling more positive about my health, irrational as this is.  It's my
way of saying "fuck off" to the grim reaper.  Like an impala leaping high
in the air when threatened by a lion, I'm saying "you are not taking me
yet; not for a long while".  Have I struck the right balance and was it
even possible?  I've not been able to test myself on rides of similar
difficulty but I'll know soon - barring disasters I'll be on a train to
Stratford early tomorrow morning, then riding to Dargo.  The next day
will test me: riding up to Mt. Hotham then down to Bright.  If I feel
ok after that, on Sunday I'll be riding to Benalla via Goldie Spur up
and over Mt. Buffalo, hopefully in time for the last train to Melbourne (a
relatively flat ride to Wodonga would also get me to a Melbourne train).
Fingers crossed!
</p>

<p> Addendum: made it! I had a great time though Goldie Spur was a
challenge.  Below is a pic from each day: Dargo river in the evening, Snow
Gum regrowth along the Dargo High Plains road and the Goldie Spur climb.
I've also had my first proper gym workout for over a month.  I lost 15-20%
of my upper body strength but no doubt I can get it back if I work on it.

<h2>Living to see the apocalypse 2/3/2020
</h2>
<a name="PSA0.12"></a>

<p> A new year and a new decade: 2020 certainly sounds like the future
and its not a good one. When I was diagnosed I did not expect to live long
enough to witness the apocalypse. My last post was from early summer and
I mentioned the climate emergency. There were a few bushfires burning at
that time. Some kept burning and became huge - big enough to create their
own weather. New fires started from lightning strikes.  2019 was the
hottest year on record for Australia.  We had the hottest day on record
in December then that record was smashed again two days later. With the
heat and prolonged drought in much of Eastern Australia the extent of
the bushfires was unprecedented, with rainforests that had never burned
before being wiped out, mass evacuations, people killed, properties
destroyed and well over a billion animals dying. It was shocking,
confronting, depressing and scary. Smoke shrouded our capital cities,
creating the worst pollution in the world at times.  I took this photo
in the late afternoon of January 6th as we walked past the university
wearing makeshift masks, as nearly all shops had sold out of P2 masks.
</p>

<center>
<img src="./smoke.jpg" width="50%"
alt="Melbourne shrouded in smoke from bushfires">
</center>

<p> Eventually the rain came, and it was red.  Red from the topsoil of
drought-stricken farms. And there were hail-storms and floods. I was
in Adelaide with family and cycling friends for the Tour Downunder at the
time, having cut short a cycling trip to Bright earlier due to the fires.
There was more red rain when we returned home. And while the extreme
weather was ravaging Australia, across the world in Wuhan the first
Covid-19 infection of humans started.  A pandemic has not yet been
declared but with thousands of people infected across every inhabited
continent it seems inevitable. Yesterday there was the first death in
Australia.  I find it all hard to take in. I want to use my sense of
humour - thats why I use the term apocalypse - but the world is in a
seriously awful state.
</p>

<p> I'm still fit and strong at least. I lost some weight when I was
unwell in November and have mostly kept it off. A couple of weeks ago
I rode from Portland to Geelong along the coast, a total of over 400km
and 3000m of climbing in almost 16 hours of riding and still had energy
at the end of the day. I did a bit too much at the gym a bit too soon
afterwards, which resulted in a touch of fatigue but I'm back to hard
rides. As I write this I'm thinking of my oncologist appointment
tomorrow and hoping my health will not be following the example set by
the rest of the world...
</p>

<p>
Yay! Great news: PSA down again, to 0.12. When Bicalutamide is
effective its often for only six months or so.  For me it has now been a
year. My oncologist once has a patient who responded well for three
years - lets hope I can match that!
</p>

<h2>D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu 27/3/2020
</h2>

<p> The COVID-19 pandemic is sweeping the world. The number of confirmed
cases has just reached 500,000, two days ago I heard the son of a friend
was infected, yesterday the first deaths in Victoria were announced,
8,000 people in Italy have died and the hospital system there has been
overwhelmed. Most countries are shut down to varying degrees. In India,
a billion people have been told to not leave their homes for three weeks
in an attempt to avert a catastrophe there. Even if such measures are
successful, the worst is yet to come and the scale of human pain and
suffering is hard to imagine.
</p>

<p>
A couple of nights ago we watched a Pola&#324;ski film on TV.  It was a
welcome distraction but all too soon the horror of reality
returned again. For me it was d&eacute;j&agrave; vu - a similar
experience to when
I was first diagnosed. In December 2013 my reality suddenly
changed - it seemed my future had been stolen. Now the same applies to
everyone to some degree.  There is fear, and more than a little
selfishness.  There is also grief.  Grief for others who will die, grief
for their loved ones and grief for ourselves, robbed of the futures we
expected and planned for. In one of my early blog entries I noted
<a href="./first.html#take_in">its hard to take in</a>. We use
distraction and denial but reality keeps hitting us, and it hurts.
</p>

<p> After I was diagnosed I said "every happy time is tinged with sadness"
- sadness of missing the future happy times that had been taken from
me. I don't feel this way with the changed reality COVID-19 has brought.
The vast majority of people will survive and I'm very hopeful I'll
be one.  The happy times will not be quite what we may have expected
but they will be there. Yesterday I rode up Kinglake.  There was no
cafe lunch for me, no coffee and no friends riding with me.  Just me,
my bike, muesli bars and the like to eat and hand sanitiser for when I
refilled my water bottles.  It was a beautiful sunny day and as I sat
alone eating lunch I admired the wonderful view. I was happy.

<h2>Same same, but different 7/7/2020
</h2>
<a name="PSA0.12a"></a>

<p>
I've always tried to update my blog soon after getting medical results.
It's been almost a month this time and I was told the good news that
my PSA was the same, 0.12.
Why has it taken me so long? Health news was a rather drawn-out affair,
the pandemic and other things have affected me emotionally and the situation
changes all the time. By the time I can take stock of the current
situation and figure out what to say, things have moved on. On the
health front, I had an appointment with my specialist GP a couple of
weeks after the oncologist. It was changed from a face to face meeting
to a tele-health appointment - I just needed to be able to take a mobile
phone call.  One advantage was it had only a slight impact on my ability
to ride my bike.  It was a nice day and I simply stopped in a sunny spot
on the way to  Hurstbridge for a while, waiting for the call.  It was a
bit of a let down as somehow my pathology results hadn't been forwarded
to the doctor.  Fortunately my oncologist had glanced over them and said
they seemed OK; I just asked my doctor to call me back if and when she
got the results and there was anything out of the ordinary.
</p>

<p> Tele-health appointments are one of the few benefits of the COVID-19
pandemic.  The first I had was several weeks earlier.  My lower back
problem had flared up again and I was unable to walk for a couple of days
- the disc seems to be gradually deteriorating. I was able to speak to my
GP and get a prescription for strong anti-inflamatories sent to the local
pharmacy.  My most recent medical appointment was a follow-up for my eye,
affected by shingles last year. I would have expected an appointment at
the Eye and Ear hospital some time ago but COVID-19 intervened. Instead,
I was up on the Kinglake ridge, on a 160km bike ride. Admittedly, it
was a bit cold sheltering behind a log for half an hour waiting for the
call. There was a bit of a breeze and it was around ten degrees after
a frosty morning but I knew it was close to a mobile phone tower, there
was sunshine and the view down Bowden Spur is one of my favourites. I
was told I should get my eye checked regularly for the rest of my
life. Hopefully the pandemic won't adversely affect it's care.  Overall,
my body seems in pretty good shape.  I've been keeping up with riding
(nearly all solo and carrying all the food I need to avoid cafe stops),
though at times I've had to battle fatigue and getting out of bed early
on cold mornings is extra hard without the motivation of organised rides
with friends.  It's also been very hard to motivate myself to do workouts
at home at times, and I have lost some upper body and core strength but
not too much I think. I've also done online yoga and pilates classes
run by my gym and quite a few local walk with family (see pic below).
</p>

<center>
<img src="./moss.jpg" width="60%"
alt="Moss and tiny mushrooms on a local walk">
</center>

<p> I've also had some intellectual exercise with a couple of colleagues,
resurrecting an algorithm animation package that was developed under
our supervision years ago but went the way of most software that is
not maintained. I did some programming for the first time in years and
designed a language for expressing algorithm descriptions with stepwise
refinement.  Emotionally, times have been tough. Oncologist visits are
always confronting, but as well there have been multiple aspects of the
pandemic, the brutal killing of George Floyd in the USA and subsequent
"Black Lives Matter" protests around world, my brother was diagnosed with
prostate cancer and various details of my father have surfaced (such as
his suicide when I was a young child) due to interest from a historian.
My brother's diagnosis was handled particularly poorly.  After a biopsy
he was initially given the all clear, which he communicated to me,
then he was told there was a mix up with the results and he had cancer
- not the ideal way to ensure emotional preparedness!  Fortunately he
was later told that the prognosis is good and they will just keep an
eye on it for now. It was a bit of a shock for me and brought back
awful memories. I felt for my brother but also realised a lot of my
feelings were centered on me, and that made me feel guilty.  I realised
I have a lot of unresolved grief related to my diagnosis and this had
re-surfaced.  I guess it's likely to stay unresolved. Since diagnosis,
I feel haunted by death. It is easier when I can but such thoughts
aside, but with oncologist visits, a deadly pandemic rolling on with
horrific consequences, my brother's diagnosis and even my father's death
popping up again after so many years, it is not surprising I have been
emotionally fragile.  Mostly I have been OK but it hasn't taken much to
get the tears flowing.
</p>

<p> Internationally, the pandemic is slowly being brought under control
in some countries (taking an optimistic view at least).  In the USA
new infections were dropping but they are now significantly increasing
again - president Trump has a lot to answer for.  Brazil has been a
disaster and is still in dire straights. I was keeping my eye on India,
with around a quarter of the world's population but rarely mentioned in
the news here. It was a slow starter but with exponential growth that
doesn't matter greatly.  After their shutdown the growth rate reduced
but not enough. It is like a runaway train on a downhill slope - slowly
accelerating with inevitable consequences.  For quite a while they had
the eleventh highest number of infections of all countries then overtook
several countries to be fourth and now it is third.
</p>

<p>
At the time of my last blog entry our whole state had just been put into
"stage three" lockdown, with only four reasons to leave home (exercise
being one of them, fortunately), limits to the size of groups, many
businesses forced to close, take-away food only at cafes etc.  By early
June some of the restrictions started being lifted and infection rates
around Australia were low.  They stayed low everywhere except Melbourne,
an the inner north and west, where we live. A week after gyms opened,
ten postcodes (including ours), went back into stage three restrictions.
I said on Facebook:
<blockquote>
I'm angry.  Angry with the people who have touched me without my
permission during this pandemic. Angry with the security guards at
quarantine hotels who behaved irresponsibly and spread COVID-19. Angry
with the idiots spreading misinformation. I have behaved responsibly.  I
want to ride my bike with friends and have smashed avocado, cappuccino
and cake at cafes with them. I've had 60+ years of being a privileged
white male and I'm not used to having my opportunities limited because
of things that are not my fault!
</blockquote>
Perhaps Facebook is not the best place to use irony as a tool to
get people to think about privilege and relative disadvantage. Our
household got tested four days ago as we were asked to and this morning
we all received text messages saying no virus was detected. Meanwhile,
infections were discovered in housing commission tower blocks and these
were immediately locked down completely without warning, so the (mostly
very vulnerable) occupants unable to leave their small apartments.
And the infection rates have continued to rise sharply over recent days.
As I write this I'm listening to the premier of our state announcing
that all of Melbourne metropolitan area plus a rural shire will be
returning to stage three restrictions, plus additional restrictions
on where we are allowed to travel to for exercise.  Things are grim,
but at least we have a premier who takes advice and acts decisively,
even if the plans are not executed with perfection.

<h2>The second wave: just staying afloat 11/10/2020
</h2>
<a name="PSA0.2"></a>

<p> Again it has taken me weeks to update my blog with the latest PSA
result, 0.2. It is a big rise in percentage terms but still very low so
there is no change in treatment. I'm not sure how well it has sunk in.
My mind has been blocking things a bit - conditions have been tough. On
my last day before the Melbourne shutdown I rode up to Healsville via
Kinglake (just outside the metro area; it has been out of bounds since
then) and back via the lovely Butterman's Track:
</p>

</center>

<p> Restricted to the metro area, I was still able to do very enjoyable
rides. Once or twice a week I would have a good drink, take two
bidons full of water and enough food and do a solid 100+km solo ride
with no contact with anything except the occasional wildflower (it
has been a wet season and at least the start of the orchid season was
spectacular). Most other days I would stay at home.  But COVID-19 cases
were still climbing (peaking at over 700 new infections in one day) and
stage four restrictions were introduced.  Exercise was limited to one hour
per day, within 5km of your home - a disaster for me (other restrictions
such as shutting down most non-essential industry and imposing a curfew
didn't affect me much).  I'm also convinced that riding on most days
close to home on relatively busy roads and the occasional very busy path
is actually less safe than my previous riding. I lasted about four days
before being hit with a bout of depression, something that has repeated
every few weeks. Riding became something to do for health rather than
pleasure. I found a small local loop that is reasonably flat, has no
traffic lights and not many cars and on a good day I could ride 34km in an
hour. I've now done more than 500 laps - around 340km and eleven hours.
On another loop I could do 500m of climbing. Some days I would take a
rest from cycling and walk with Donna. Plus there was work to be done
in the garden, a bit of work on the algorithm animation system and even
some work on the compiler for the Pawns programming language I developed
years ago. Not much fun bit I was surviving.  </p>

<p> With the tight restrictions imposed the infection rate in Melbourne
reduced quite rapidly and we were allowed two hours of exercise per day
(along with various other relaxations), reducing the pressure I feel to
make the most of the allowed time.  I'm always afraid of losing strength
and not being able to recover it.  This is not entirely irrational since
I have no testosterone but despite rarely being motivated enough to do
other exercise at home I've not lost too much upper body strength so I'm
probably a bit over-worried about it.  In another week the exercise limit
was scheduled to be relaxed, assuming the infection rate had dropped
to five per day, but it looks like that won't happen and the 5km limit
will be around for a while more. As I write this the Premier is giving
his daily press conference giving some details of the bad news.
</p>

<p> I've had one friend with COVID-19 - a smoker, so it was very worrying
for a while but fortunately it was a mild case. Being a relatively
young and fit cyclist no doubt helped but working in health care he was
expecting to get infected at some stage.  Despite all the precautions,
the health sector has had a large number of infections.  Aged care
is the other worst hit sector, with many vulnerable people dying.
Mum's nursing home has been spared to date but was locked down most of
the time. Between stricter lockdowns and before stage 4 restrictions I
was able to have a brief "courtyard" visit. Since then was occasional
video chats via computer, with a nurse helping mum. She declined further
and became less responsive. Possibly the lack of interaction made here
decline faster and on a couple of calls last month she was dozing off
and not really responding at all.  A couple of weeks ago we received a
message that she was moving to palliative care. In the evening she had
declined further and my brother visited her. She died later that night.
It has been a sad time, but we have been losing her gradually for
years and in the end she was just a shadow of her former self. Mum was
a remarkable woman and we are still finding out more things about her
from people who have contacted us after hearing of her death. I won't
try to do justice to her life here but many of the values I hold dear
have come from her and others that we share (such as being vegetarian)
we both arrived at later in life.
</p>


<h2>Yes, COVID-19 can be eliminated 11/12/2020
</h2>
<a name="PSA0.24"></a>

<p> The COVID-19 infection rate kept falling, restrictions were
eventually eased and Victoria had no new COVID-19 cases for over forty
days - yay! Everyone is hoping that the revamped quarantine and contact
tracing systems will be more effective this time around and allow
another wave of infections as they did previously. A few days ago the
first quarantine cases were announced. Some countries are just beginning
mass immunisations, exceeding expectations also, though the number of
COVID-19 cases is many countries is still horrific. The USA, with all
its resources, has had an epic fail of leadership. At least Trump lost
his bid for re-election (despite his baseless claims to the contrary).
Early official modelling at the start of the pandemic suggested that
eliminating COVID-19 would be extremely difficult and suppression was
the only realistic strategy. I did a little reading about the modelling
and was shocked at how simple (arguably simplistic) the model was. It
did not take advantage of modern computing and could quite feasibly
have been done with a pencil and paper. I read an article arguing that
agent-based modelling (much more computing intensive) was a far better
approach and it suggested elimination may be a realistic goal. I had
to agree.  Although the Victorian government did not officially adopt
an elimination strategy, they did take heed of the better modelling and
it turned out to be very accurate: a quiet victory for computer science.
</p>

<p> On my first day of freedom I repeated my Kinglake/Healsville ride,
with a couple of extra hills. That plus a bit of additional exercise
was a bit much and I suffered a bout of fatigue, which lead to my lower
back problems flaring up again. As I was getting back into upper body
exercises my muscles felt they were seizing up. I was lacking energy
and experiencing quite a lot of varied pain. It felt very similar to the
period just before I was diagnosed.  Although I knew my PSA must still
be low and my cancer not very active, I was scared. At first I didn't
want to upset Donna so I suffered in silence, but it turned out she
was thinking the same thing. I think during lockdown my body lost some
of it's endurance and ability to recover quickly from hard rides but
has been improving since. The Saturday before last I did a pretty tough
gravel ride and on Wednesday I rode over 300km. It was kind of impromptu
- the possibility had crossed my mind but I hadn't made any real plan
and decided to see what I felt like doing on the day. I got up early,
in time to meet friends in St Kilda who were going to do a quick ride
to Mordialloc and back but I kept going, and going.
</p>

<p> What would motivate me to do such a thing? My oncologist appointment
was the next day. My PSA has increased to 0.24 - a lower percentage
increase than last time and not too bad under the circumstances. Other
blood tests were also ok and I also had another bone density scan
recently and my bone density declined less in the last two years than the
previous two.  Riding is one way I cope with the anxiety leading up to PSA
test results and doing extra long rides makes me feel my demise is more
distant. I've done a 300+km ride in each of the last three summers and
felt a bit under pressure (only from myself) to do the same this summer.
Now the pressure is off and, having done another solid ride last
Saturday, it seems my body is able to recover reasonably well again,
in time to head up to Bright after Christmas. With all the tests,
results etc I actually forgot the seventh anniversary of my diagnosis -
I've done amazingly well!
</p>

<p> I'm also adjusting to more "normal" life again.  I was socially
quite isolated since the early in the first wave of infections. We were
conservative when restrictions were eased at the end of the first wave
(my first time on public transport since early this year was about a
week ago). I felt significant post-lockdown anxiety when restrictions
were first eased. For most of my life I've felt rather awkward socially
and it has been tough re-adjusting, especially with larger groups. I saw
my brother for the first time in months and with our immediate families
we scattered mum's ashes in the Yarra river, close to where she once
lived. It involved a bush walk along the river - something mum would
have enjoyed greatly.  She was very much against having a funeral,
or any sentimental gestures such as what we did, and wanted her body
donated to Melbourne University. Due to COVID that was not possible so
she was cremated and we ended up with her ashes. I think funerals and
the like are for the living, not the dead, and it was fitting that her
remains were returned to nature in this way.
</p>

<p>
Our daughter is becoming more independent. This year she wanted to have
a party with a small number of friends, and was not so keen on having
parents around. So for the first time we missed her birthday and had our
anniversary (28 years since we met) with just the two of us, away in
Marysville for a long weekend. Lots of lovely walking together
(see pic below) and I also squeezed in a quick meetup ride up to Lake
Mountain and back. I do feel I should be more productive in some ways
but life is pretty good overall.

<h2>Best be prepared for bad news 20/4/2021
</h2>
<a name="PSA0.37"></a>

<p> I didn't prepare myself for bad news but I received some a month ago
(writing up this entry has been a bit of a struggle). I did a quick
calculation to figure out what a reasonable PSA result would be just
before my oncology appointment but mostly I had tried to push such
thoughts aside. There was underlying stress but I wasn't thinking about
the state of my disease. My PSA had jumped to 0.37 - still very low in
absolute terms but a significant jump in percentage terms.  My oncologist
was apologetic, which is never a good sign. It seems likely that the
medication I'm currently on is no longer effective and he said to get
another test in time for an appointment in six weeks time.  It shouldn't
have come as a surprise as it has been two years and it is rare for the
medication to be effective for that long. I felt fine for the first few
days but then my emotions kicked in.
</p>

<p> I'm still very fit (riding up hills faster than ever in fact, though
not recovering so well and balancing exercise with rest to avoid bouts
of fatigue has been challenging) but it's hard not to be depressed when
you take another step along a path that (almost) inevitably leads to
an unhappy end. Is it particularly difficult when you don't know what
will come next. I wish I had asked the oncologist what the likely next
treatment would be. I feel like it would lessen the anxiety and I may
be able to prepare for whatever it is. Easter was a particularly tough
time. I caught a cold and though I should do the right thing and get
a COVID-19 test, even though there had been no community cases for
four weeks and I had no contact with people from elsewhere. For some
reason (perhaps Easter) my test took a very long time to process and
I was never contacted with the result. By the fifth day of staying at
home, not exercising, sleeping alone, not touching anyone and feeling
like whenever I touched anything without washing my hands first I was
potentially spreading disease, I was in a bad way (see pic below; the
current rules here are that you must self-isolate while waiting for a
COVID test result). We eventually found out the test was negative, of
course, but the episode was far worse for me than it should have been and
I think may have had a lasting effect on my mental health. I contacted
some local MPs in an attempt to improve the system for others.  </p>

<p> I've been trying to do the right things for my mental health. I ride
lots, of course, and during rest times often go for walks with my partner
and/or others. I seek out sunshine, though there hasn't been much of
that in Melbourne in recent days. I try to do good things for others.
I've delivered our delicious figs far and wide. I've met up with several
riders in the <a href="https://www.indianpacificwheelrace.com/about">
Indian Pacific Wheel Ride</a> as they have ridden through Melbourne on
their way from Freemantle to Sydney. I've donated money to help buy
back and protect some of the <a href="https://www.rainforest4.org/">
Daintree Rainforest</a>. I could have seen more friend and talk more
about how I feel but I'm not feeling social and feel like I would be
a bit of a burden. Expressing myself in Facebook doesn't seem to be an
effective way of getting real interaction with friends. I've not seen my
psychologist for a while - I feel my depression is a reasonably rational
response to the situation, though a chat with him might be beneficial and
he might even suggest some strategies. I've wondered if anti-depressants
would be a good option. One thing that seemed to help was getting another
PSA test done yesterday.  Normally it results in additional anxiety but
I feel a sense of relief that the wait is almost over.  My oncologist
appointment is next week. I don't expect a good result (particularly
since I rode 130km just before getting the test done).  Hopefully I'll
be able to write up a blog entry a bit more promptly this time around.
</p>

<h2>Relief and tragedy 28/4/2021
</h2>
<a name="PSA0.4"></a>

<p>
Its been a tough few weeks and I'll have to work on strategies to make
it easier in the future, but I felt somewhat relieved after my
oncologist visit yesterday.  My PSA had a small increase, to 0.4. This
is still consistent with a doubling time of around six months (which is
not good and suggests to me that the current medication is not working),
but the oncologist said doubling times when the PSA level is low are not
so reliable and suggested staying with the same medication for now, with
slightly more frequent tests. I guess with a low PSA there is no urgency
to move onto the next medication.  I asked about what options come next,
as uncertainty is on of the things that has increased my stress. There
are a couple of older medications that are generally well tolerated and
probably worth trying. Then there is a stronger form of hormone therapy
that tends to cause more fatigue. Later there is chemotherapy and
clinical trials. I can't say I feel good about the result - it would
have been much nicer if the previous result was an aberration and I had
a lower PSA this time around. But I feel a bit less stressed at least
and prepared to keep on living the way I have been. Another fast ride
getting up before dawn today, a two day bike packing trip this
coming weekend, a few push-ups and chin-ups (I almost gave up on these a
while ago) and occasional pilates at home.
</p>

<p> I've been mostly thinking about my own problems recently, but a much
greater tragedy is unfolding elsewhere with the pandemic getting worse in
several countries, despite vaccines. As I feared, India is being hit very
hard, with over 300,000 new infections per day for the last week, oxygen
running out and people being turned away from overflowing hospitals.
I expected this would happen much earlier but somehow it looked like they
were getting things under control. Perhaps they became a bit complacent.
Huge religious gatherings didn't help. Heart breaking.
