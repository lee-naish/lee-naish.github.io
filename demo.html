<h1>A Simple Demonstration of HTML</h1>

<p>
Here is some simple text.
The browser will wrap
the text over several lines to make it more readable.
The number of
lines will depend on the size of the window,
the font size chosen etc,
which will vary depending on whether you are looking at this on a
desktop computer with a large screen or a small hand-held device.
What follows is an <em>un-numbered list</em> containing some links
and other junk.
